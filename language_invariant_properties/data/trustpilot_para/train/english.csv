We have many online businesses and refuse to allow any review site to take control of our reputation - if they choose too. You are maybe asking for trouble if you sign up *** UPDATED (after 3 months of usage) ... I've changed our original rating from 1 star to 3 stars.. We've not yet had a negative review and was expecting one or two from known competitors who do this sort of thing. If we do receive a fake negative review I am confident now that we can report the review as fake and have it removed without too much aggravation.,32,25-54,M

"If you want to know how they really are, just ask someone that have bought Simcity 2013 to them. They were selling bunches of keys of the game on ""pre-order"" months before the release date, promising they would get the key 2 days before the release. The keys were Hungarian (not multi-language) and ""unexpectedly"" the majority of people didn't want to play in Hungarian. What they basically did on the release date is to ignore all the pre-orders and continue selling more expensive multi-language keys to new customers (who were going to pay more for it) while lying the pre-order customers with empty promises and broken deadlines (around 10 broken deadlines) about when were they going to get what they paid for months ago. Today is the release day, I'm a pre-order customer, it's 21:49 and I don't have the key I bought to them long ago and should have arrived 2 days ago. There are quite a lot of people like me and no explanations. Well, some of the ones that have got theirs say their keys were already used (and now have kind of a second problem). I just recommend you to run away from their services as far as you can.",28,25-54,M

"We bought two cars in the past twelve months both times using CarsDirect.com.  In both cases they were extremely helpful in locating the vehicles in a timely manner.  The visit to the dealership the first time was less than 30 minutes, totally painless.  The second purchase , no so much.  The Finance Manager was a total jerk and screwed up the paperwork.  He was making us travel all the way back to accomodate his mistake (it was easily an hour drive, round trip).  Rather than dong this, we simply called our contact at CarsDirect.com and he set the dealership straight and made them mail us the corrected documents to sign.  I will always use CarsDirect.com, the amount I could save negotiating on my own is not worth the countless headaches it would require.",45,25-54,M

I still make sure to always check this site along with other booking search engines when planning a trip.  Some great pluses are that they were recently having a sale, so we ended up getting our accommodation even cheaper, and the customer service is very good.  I contacted them about a cancellation after not hearing back from the hostel and they made sure that it was all sorted out for me.  Also, no booking fee!

Just found this site looking for the best deal on some MHP IsoFast 50.  They didn't have the best price...until I plugged in the competitor's price and then they BEAT the best price I could find.  True they don't offer free shipping...but they're pretty honest about the deal since the sites I compared that offered free shipping truly were more expensive in the long run. Now to see how fast the shipment comes in.  I'm originally from Wisconsin (where they company is located) and now live in CA so hopefully the shipment gets here fast.  I'm almost out of protein and don't want to go to the local store and pay $18 more per container. Thanks SupplementWarehouse!,42,25-54,M

"I engaged Taxes for Expats because I finally reached a breaking point as an expat living overseas. I'd asked dozens of people about how to deal with working for a UN organization and meeting my obligations as a US citizen with regard to paying taxes. No two people ever gave me the same answer. I don't remember how I found Taxes for Expats, but when I did, I thought, ""What have I got to lose? They can't be any worse than the last guy I hired. At the very least, maybe they'll actually respond to my questions."" Taxes for Expats' customer service is excellent! Their website is comprehensive and user-friendly. Their services are thorough. When I had questions, I'd send my tax accountant an email and she would respond within 24 hours. On top of that, the price was right, especially after being quoted prices by various other firms both in the US and in Europe ranging from $300 to $1,500 for a return. All-in-all, Taxes for Expats is outstanding and worth every penny. I'll definitely be engaging them again for my 2014 taxes.",46,25-54,F

"Picking my stone was easy. The site was simple to navigate, and the price was reasonable. The checkout process was a little bit tricky. I didn't like the idea if walking into the bank and handing over money blindly. I was originally given an account number for an account that had been closed. The person at the bank cautioned me about purchasing my stone with no record of the transaction besides a deposit. After many phone calls I decided to pay with a credit card.  Paying with a credit card was a much easier option, but the discount did not apply that way.",40,25-54,F

At the end of each reply from your support I get a sentence like ""I see you no longer need our assistance..."" what makes you think so if you've never asked if I need further assistance?

I know some other sites have brand exclusivity, but with the wide selection of supplements on the site, you can find always find a similar product at a great price. Shipping has gone way up since using fedex/ ups compared to usps back in the day. I can see why after the first couple mix ups and lack of tracking, but they have seemed to fix that problem.

WTF?? As i preordered and watched 1 day ago there was no message, this message was sent after sending me my key. I made a screenshot and supporter told me then, they will resell the key and if the buyer can activate the key i will get refunde after 72 hours. then i waited but after 72 hours still no refunde, then there was a few prolems because i opend a case with paypal, i closed this case but was a bit scary that i dont get refunde after doing this, but all went good, after a few hours i got all my money back.

"Ordered a set of stickers for a Triumph Street Triple, I paid for first class recorded delivery (£3.50ish), as I was in the middle of painting a bike for a friend I expected to get these within a day or two at the most, after having no sign of them 3 days later I called to enquire on their whereabouts. The guy I spoke to told me he hadn't ""gotten around"" to doing them yet and that he'd been planning  on making them on Sunday to post on Monday, I didn't get an appology either. Stickers finally arrived on Wensday, If I'm paying for something like this and I'm charged first class recorded I sort of expect to not have to wait over a week for them to arrive because someone plainly just can't be bothered to pull his finger out any sooner, also making a profit off the postage charges is a cheap thing to do (postage was well under £2..the envelope didn't cost the rest I'm sure). Overall the stickers where pretty good, just a shame I had to wait so long to get them, I would have used you again but sadly after this sort of treatment I'll go elsewhere.",42,25-54,M

"There is a reason why PHP Designer is rated so high above other IDEs, It has everything. It has an FTP client, PHP Manual, PHP live syntax checking, popup info on function usage, and so much more! The layout can be customized to any developers needs or wants, along with changing the color of the syntax. It supports the norm of CSS, JS, PHP, HTML, but also many other languages. The interface is intuitive, easy to use, and fully packed with useful  features.  Also my favorite feature is: its ability to beautify code. It makes your code much easier to read and to develop with. If you are a web developer seeking for a good editor that doesn't cost huge amounts like Adobe's products, get PHP Designer! I personally think it is better than Adobe's.",18,15-24,M

"Frankly, I paid about $100 for a warranty that cost me $100 later to have my daughter's phone repaired.  So in the end, I basically paid $200 for a used phone.  (I could've just tossed it and bought a new Moto G for $180.) I took it to a local repair shop that said they wouldn't repair it because it had water damage along with the cracked screen.  So I had to send it to Square Trade who actually sent me back a different phone.  (I can tell because the edges of my daughter's phone had scratches and this one doesn't have water damage.)  So did they resolve the issue?  Absolutely.  Was it worth buying the insurance?  Nope.",39,25-54,M

I ordered midevial renaissance low cut boot. The sizing is poor. I ordered size available 12/13 and measured from heel to toe was about 11/2 inches to big.

"So the transaction online was very simple and was the best price.  I'm generally the person that feels you get what you pay for, but I took a crap shoot hoping all would go well.  Firstly, priceline booked my room through their 'sister' company, booking.com.  While I normally would not care if everyone was peachy, it matters now when you have a problem. So I arrive at the hotel and they do not have a booking for me and they are full, now I'm stuck with 3 tired kids and no room.  20 minutes on hold to even talk to a rep with priceline and 20 minutes on hold while they 'research' to see what is going on just to be told that I need to be connected to a booking.com rep.  After 30 minutes of talking and holding with booking.com rep they finally tell me they will call me back.  Never happened.  After about 2 hours the person at the hotel told me that someone just cancelled and I now can get a room. If it had not been for someone cancelling, I would have been stuck without a room.  Priceline/Booking.com were of no help to me and they are the ones that put me in the predicament that I was in.  My booking was for 2 nights and I was only able to use 1 of those 2 nights due to the hotel being booked on the 2nd day.  We ended up cutting our vacation short, thanks Priceline!",32,25-54,M

"I ordered the ""Bad Alice"" wig. In the picture it shows a platinum blond/white hair with the black longer hair. The wig arrived and I couldn't even distinguish where the side part was supposed to be. It was a mess of crusty glue and visible hairline seams. The hair color was a golden/brassy color, not platinum. It is supposed to be straight and it was very wavy all over. I did everything the wig experts tell you to do when styling a wig but only slightly improved the wavy look.  The ends are frizzy all over and look as though they have been melted. The longer black under layer of hair doesn't even go all the way around. It starts in the correct  place on the right side but stops behind the ear on the left side. It DOES NOT look anything at all like the picture online. In the picture it looks very Goth, (we got it for a dead bride costume) It is so golden yellow it isn't GOTH at all. The only redeeming part of this purchase was the clearance price of $3.99+shipping. If I had paid the regular price of $12.99 I would have sent it back immediately.",43,25-54,F

"A dealership more like a  friend. Low Pressure / No Pressure Sales team.  The quality of their late model used car selection was phenomenal.  Almost all the cars were bought from car rentals or private owners who maintained their vehicles .  The plus is Warranty, 5 business Day return policy no questions asked , the 30-Day major system repair coverage with no out of pocket expense, plus an incredible extended warranty (3 yr 36,000 miles and 5 yr,  60,000 mile coverage. Bought SUV on July 5th.  July 6th the A/C stopped blowing cold air.  Called AEVEREX (service contract administrator) and explained the problem.  I am now scheduled for repair on Wed, July 9th with NO out of pocket expense, whether it's just a freon recharge, A/C compressor, or water pump. I have always bought late model used cars (never new) and I have never had such complete comprehensive coverage if something breaks nor ever had such great customer service - national customer support center for DriveTime called me on Monday, July 7th, to congratulate me on my purchase and to ask about my experience with sales rep and finance mgr at the dealership - this was a FIRST. Normally when I bought used and drove it off the lot, I'd never hear from the dealership again and start getting harassed about my loan payment, even though with those other dealerships my payment wouldn't be due for a month! DriveTime East in Indianapolis, thanks for a great experience.  Special thanks to sales associate Chad Horsley, who took care of paperwork and car prep for delivery on my purchase. DON'T go to any mom & pop buy here pay here lot , or even large local dealership (like GM, Chevrolet, Ford, KIA, etc. ).  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DriveTime , which is nationwide!  I even have the option of activating my built-in OnStar service - something I have never even offered before on a used car. If you go to DriveTime to purchase a car, truck, or SUV, use my name (Jeffery Wolfe in Indianapolis).  I'll be eligible for their referral program !!

"Ok, so I have been struggling with losing and managing my weight as well as staying healthy. I swear I have so many physical and health problems from my surgeries in the past I just felt that I would never stay as fit and healthy as I wanted to. However when one of my family members had this ""heavy duty shaker bottle"" from this place called supplement warehouse I immediately questioned her on where she purchased that awesome looking bottle. Once she told me about the site, the rest was history. See I was purchasing meal replacements from other places but the prices for all foods and organic items are crazy sky high, but unfortunately I kept paying for the meal replacements that I wanted because I couldn't find any place else that was selling it. Well, not only does this sight sell what most stores don't, it compares prices to other competitors. I was literally able to find an item on another site, post the URL in the item I wanted from Supplement Warehouse and I got it for cheaper on this sight.

They always have what I'm looking for and the specials they run on different products are a great deal.  The shipping fee is at a good price. I have no issue with what they charge.

Even shopping for the products I order locally can't compare! I love their newsletter and often browse through their products to see what is new and what they have to say about it.

I got it and am satisfied with the quality for what I paid. I feel bad for saying they were a scam. Clearly they do produce these items. I do believe they should not rely on the USPS with no tracking for their shipping. It is not a good plan and has left many shoppers stressed.",44,25-54,F

So I got squaretrade for my Galaxy s4.  Two days later I was hiking, and while attempting the difficult maneuver of taking a photograph, I dropped the phone onto a rock and shattered the screen. Easily contacted squaretrade and they quickly approved local repair.  Next day I had a working phone.  They refunded my repair cost in another day (via amazon gift card which is cool and gives an extra %).",39,25-54,F

I discovered YesStyle in March of 2011 and immediately started shopping on the website. I'm glad I'm a silver member this year!

We did over a Million dollars a year with them,  have a 10 year history and then they decided to demand with out choice that they are going to  hold 10% of all funds for 90 days.

I've been doing business with this company for about six months. And I'vebeen satisfied so far . Usually have to buy in bulk to save money after shipping. It's been tough since i got laid off.

"I will tell you, I have looked at other supplement shops and always find myself coming back to Supplement Warehouse.  First of, it's the unbelievable selection, they have just about everything.  Second, it's the pricing.  Normally, they are the lowest I have found, but if they are not, they will match and beat the competitors price.  How awesome is that?  Finally, it's the fact they DO NOT use USPS, so you actually get your stuff quick.  Shipping charges aren't bad, but with the cheaper prices, it's still a win-win.  If you haven't tried this shop, it's worth a try.  I have been a loyal supporter for years.",40,25-54,M

"I was trying to book four rooms for my family and had an extremely difficult time booking with one reservation. Online you can only do three, the same is true when you call the toll free number. Group booking only allows you to book if you have nine rooms or more. It was very frustrating getting in touch with someone who could help me and eventualy just booked two seperate reservations, keeping fingers crossed that the same hotel and flights would still be available. There has to be an easier way.",33,25-54,F

"Brilliance was absolutely phenomenal. After doing a lot of research both in the on and offline world for a good ring, I ended up chatting with a member of their staff. They were easy to talk to, very professional, and even more knowledgeable. Even more impressive is the fact that they recommended what was best for me, not what was the MOST EXPENSIVE. At the end of the day, I got a brilliant elegant engagement ring for my beautiful fiancee, that was at a great price, and looked even better. I would recommend Brilliance to anyone, and in fact I will. Their staff cannot be beat, and their quality of both diamonds and bands are second to none. I will definitely be using them in the future.",22,15-24,M

"Apartment Terrace St Peter in Rome was convenient because of access to all forms of public transport nb no. 64 bus which goes to Piazza Venezia giving easy access to the Forum etc; and also located a short walk/bus ride from St Peter's. Simone was really nice and helpful. There is  a very good local restaurant - unfortunately, thinking we would go back, I did not collect card + name but Simone will know. Good price. Not a luxury apartment but for the price it is excellent value.",57,55-64,F
"Pros: Ordering was easy Cons: (1) Web site is not functional- nowhere in my account to view previous orders. Nowhere to enter a promotional code for savings when I checked out. (2) They do not keep an accurate inventory- I was told several days after an order that they could not fill it. (3) Return policy is unreasonable. I tried to cancel an order within two days and they told me that there would be a 20% restocking fee. Not sure what they were going to restock since the order didn't get mailed until about a week and a half after I placed the order. (4) VERY slow service. Ordered FRAMES ONLY on 4/28. They shipped on 5/7. Can't imagine how long it would have been if they would have needed to do something other than put them in a box and mail them. (5) There are less expensive places out there. Keep looking (6) The frames arrived undamaged, but the inside of the RayBan case was cracked. Finally- I paid with a FSA card. I am having difficulty getting a receipt from them that has all the necessary information. You should just avoid the headache.",45,25-54,M
"I ordered about $100 worth of clothes (4 sweatpants & an oversized shirt). Granted, the shirt was really thin and the quality was not top-notch, but I still love all of my clothes. They fit me perfectly (despite being one-size) and shipping was pretty fast despite 2 of the items having the 7-14 day availability wait. The sweats are super comfortable and I even got compliments from friends about one of my sweats (it's no longer available). Also I realize that the items would be way cheaper if I were in HK but compared to American stores like Abercrombie/A&E/Aero/Hollister that I usually shop at I'd say ordering online at YS is still a much better deal. All in all, I would definitely be ordering from YS again. :)",18,15-24,F

"I have placed countless orders with Supplement Warehouse. It doesn't matter whether using their online ordering service or making one over the phone the process is a cinch. Their prices are always competitive with many other companies, and if they don't beat them they will match them, what more could you want!? I recommend anyone looking to beat the outrageous prices at big chain supplement stores to shop around on their website. It won't even be a contest on whether or not purchase through them.",23,15-24,M

I cannot fault Suntransfers at all. The Booking process online was easy and hassle free. We travelled to Marjorca on 20th July 2013 and our driver was waiting for us at Palma airport with a clearly named card. Therre was no chance of missing him. He was courteous and the vehicle was more than adequate for 4 adults - fully air-conditioned and comfortable transfer. The expereince was even better coming back as the driver arrived early and agreed to wait around for my son and his friend who were due to meet us at the originally agreed time. the vehicle was even better on the return. Definitely 5 Stars for SunTransfers and I would not hesitate to use again.,45,25-54,M

The website is really easy to maneuver around o(≧∇≦o) to find out what you need, as is checking out and there's always some type of promotion or coupon to help you save even more money. The only con?

Their website accepted my order and I called several times to make sure they had my order and confirm it was coming before Thanksgiving. The more calls I made the more disappointed I got. Each time we called their CS department they told us a different story: (1) they have 2 orders under my name!!! REALLY? (2) No order was found under my name or order number???!!!

"We had a very good experience with your business. We were able to get a prompt appointment and Sean was very informative. I was comfortable having him work in my home while I was there with my three children. He was so professional. We like that Sean wasn't just trying to press us to buy everything. He really tried to help us figure out what would be the best investment to keep us safe and give us peace of mind. He was well informed with the crime statistics in our neighborhood, and was able to give us helpful tips for different circumstances. After all the upset in Lake Highlands lately, we are so thankful that Smith Monitoring was right on top of everything. Thank you Sean! Caroline and Brian Mitchell",32,25-54,F

"Dear Sir/Madame, This is to let you know that Annie, who answered an early call provided me with excellent service.  I needed to make flight changes to a previous itinerary due to serious health conditions of an aunt I wanted to spend time with.  Annie actively sought information from me regarding the circumstances surrounding my need to urgently change flight schedules.  She provided options that helped me to decide on the best airport, time and day while being considerate with the financial consequences of the flight changes.  I felt that Annie gave importance to what I needed.",35,25-54,M

Im on the front page and there is a search engine staring at me so I put in ""Disney,"" and get three choices; France, Florida, and Anaheim. Cool. I click on Florida and I'm in hotel heaven.

This is not the first cd key I purchased from this site and I am proud to say that I am very amazed at the quick delivery they have been supporting me with. The CD keys I have been receiving over the years are not fake & work perfectly. The only cautious behavior one needs to take when purchasing products from here is to make sure the keys are not region locked and that they work at where you live. I rate their service an A++++ 10/10.,20,15-24,M

"The car and the service were great! Very helpful for a foreigner that neglected to brush up on the language before traveling! However, I checked off that I needed a gps device and there were none available,  and the only car available with gps was WAY out of my price range. So, the girl google mapped directions and printed it out for me and gave me several maps. It was fantastic customer service, but after getting severely lost, I ended up spending about $500 in roaming charges by using the navigation on my cell phone...so that sucked! Thankfully, I arrived at my destination just in time to keep on schedule. The car they gave me was brand new, not much horse power, but didn't really need it, and I could make it perform if I needed to accelerate quick at merges. I was very happy with the car and the service overall.",37,25-54,F

Everyone has commented on how they like my choices and i've had no problems at all. They arrive in reasonable cases,so no problems from the start. I would definitely order again from Selectspecs.",52,25-54,F
I have been shopping at Supplement Warehouse for about 3 years and every purchase has been great.  They carry a wide range of products and the process is painless.

"I bought a Samsung Galaxy 3 7 inch Tablet for $150 and the extended 2 year protection plan of $50 more from TigerDirect a few months back.  I broke the screen and took it back to the store for repair and I was told by the store that I needed to call the warranty company and send the unit back.  The warranty company is called Square Trade and the person I talked to was in Pakistan.  The person I talked to said his name was Ryan (That was with a Heavy Accent), He told me that the tablet could not be fixed and they were sending me my money back $150 for what I paid for the tablet once they had received  the tablet.  I asked why they couldn’t fix it and he said that it would cost more to repair it than what it cost.  Then He said that if it had cost $125 to fix it then my warranty would only have $25 left for future repairs. I asked to talk to his supervisor and he said there were 4 of them but they were with clients and it would take 3 hours for me to get a response from them. I asked for one of the names of the supervisor and he gave me the name Sylvia (remember this is a call center in Pakistan.  I gave up dealing with them and sent the tablet back. I have also been receiving a lot of junk mail since I gave the rep my email address. They did send me a check for $150 so I went to BestBuy and bought a new one and there warranty. I do not recommend TigerDirect or Square Trade.",49,25-54,M

"I've purchased warranties throughout my life, an odd thing I tell you since I really treat myself in a devil may care way, I run marathons, I hike mountains, I eat whole cheese cakes and I train martial arts and get my body and feathers ruffled on a day to day occurrence. So, when I bought a Canon G10 years ago, and used it on a trip, I also purchased a Squaretrade warranty along with it. The warranty sat, unused for years. Two and a half to be exact, so I got that familiar feeling anyone gets when they get the clear coat put on their car, or the cabbage they bought that spoiled, that feeling of, unused service. Which was fine, I went on thinking ignorance was bliss and never sure if I would ever need Squaretrade for future purchases, as I seemed to take care of my things. And then, while hiking around Arizona on a cross country drive, the wind decided to be my nemesis and knock my tripod mounted camera forwards and into a rock filled path of discomfort. The camera build like the 8 bit Nintendo survived the scuffle with gravity but not completely unphased, a slight scratch had found it's way onto my lens, visible in photo's. I finished my cross country trek, contacted squaretrade through a few clicks and presto, box in the mail and a few days later my camera were being repaired. I know such, as I got emails updating me on it's status. Then it arrived back, and my lens was fixed and my life were better and I have bought a warranty through squaretrade on everything I buy. Everything, camera lens and such from ebay, keyboards from amazon. I hardly ever use the warranties, currently I have 9 and have only required their service 3 times. Another fight with gravity and my phone, and my kindle deciding it didn't want to be a e-reader and instead opted for paper weight. I have recommended them to friends and chuckled when they said, ""No need."" And then six months later when the moon was full and the temperature was right, and they dropped their phone's down and escalator at the mall whilst eating kettle cooked corn. I am not an insured person's, I feel no need as I am still young enough to feel invincible and just old enough to know which things to avoid in mass quantities at buffet lines, but if square trade ever offers health insurance, I would be first in line. Until then, ever gadget I own is in their hands. Truly, all of them.",58,55-64,M
"Have used this site on previous occasions. Definitely love the price match option. Prices are among, if not the lowest, on the internet.  For an athlete, Supplementwarehouse.com is a big advantage for purchasing in bulk.  They ship very quick and I love the amount of free merchandise available.  I do not find the high shipping prices to be a disadvantage; when ordering a lot, high shipping should be expected. Will definitely be using this site more often to fit my needs.",24,15-24,M
"Yesstyle is honestly my one stop website for clothing. They have such wide selections and for such reasonable prices. I love everything they have to offer and love to browse their shop ALL the time. If you get express shipping for just a little extra then your clothes arrive within 5 days, it's crazy! I LOVE IT!! Always recommend this site to not just girls but guys as well. You would be a fool not to shop here.",19,15-24,F
"Love this site, love the selection, their prices are always great but I do believe they make up for their prices with shipping. It usually takes at least 5 days to ship to me down here in Texas and the shipping is never less than $11. Something about that doesn't add up... Would be 5 stars if shipping were either quicker and $11 or cheaper and as slow.",30,25-54,M
"The car was great, value for money excellent. The only problem was tryng to locate the drop off location. The branch's phone system was down so we couldn't get directions.

"I paid a lot of money for what I was expecting would be a quality suit, and received a very poorly fit suit of cheap material. After contacting their Support Ticket staff, my conversation with a man named Stefano was unhelpful and at times incoherent. The company refused to correct their mistake, which would do no harm or extra cost to them, and only take mere minutes of their time. I was hoping to buy more suits and clothing from them in the future, but I no longer think that I want to do that!!! Overall, DON'T throw your money away on a suit with this company!!! Edit: Finally, when I had to leave for business and was going to be unavailable for a few weeks, somebody decided to take over the situation and help me. Because of my leave (over which I had no choice), they closed their offer to help. Very unprofessional company. Will update should any changes occur.",21,15-24,M
Overall great deals! Don't have to order from many different places now.,30,25-54,F
"We ordered 2 parts and the invoice indicated that they were both shipped via Fed-EX under one tracking number in two boxes. Fed-Ex arrived with just one box; and our initial reaction was that the Fed-Ex guy kept our other package. So we called Fed-Ex and they indicated that it was always just one box weighting the correct amount for the one item and nothing more. We then tried to find a number we could call and find out what happened to the other part that now showed as delivered, when it wasn't. That's when I realized there was no customer service # to call, so I googled Parts Geek to find numerous complaint of similar incidents and the people never receiving their item, along with many other types of complaints. At this point we thought, we have been ripped off, so I called the bank to stop payment for the item I did not receive while I waited for an email reply from the company within the next 24-48 hours. turns out the other part was on it's way via UPS under a different tracking #, now I have to call the bank back and I am stuck with a part I can no longer use for we had to buy it local when it didn't arrive as indicated on the shipping invoice. Actually found it local for less and had it in minutes versus the 7-8 days it took to get here. All because their shipping invoice was incorrect and I could not reach a live person. I will never buy from them again, ever.",32,25-54,M

"Yodel was supposed to deliver a phone to me then apparently ""attempted"" delivery without leaving a calling card. I rescheduled, they didn't deliver and said there was no log of a rescheduling.

"I am totally impressed with the selection, price, and free shipping. Great job! I hope you guys will email more coupons and discounts. Lots of American companies do this so you'll have to keep up to stay competitive since your shipping time is pretty long. Anyway, great stuff, can't wait to try it all on. :)",35,25-54,F
The site always has great prices so you don't have to shop around if you don't want to without worrying too much but if you do and find a couple of things cheaper somewhere else the Price Comparison feature is easy to use and works well. My orders always come quickly. My go to place for supplements. The only thing I'd change is I'd prefer they used the USPS instead of UPS.,30,25-54,M
Received an incorrect part. I emailed and same day there was a response and the part was shipped. Easy and no hassle.,28,25-54,M
Yesstyle is one of the cutest and trendiest clothing companies out there.  You can't find this style of clothing anywhere in the US.  They always stay on top of the trends and if you watch for the sales anything you want can be easily acquired.  I will never go anywhere else for my clothing.  The only problem is that sometimes the quality is really lacking and the sizes are sometimes a bit off from what they say they are.,29,25-54,F

"I've bought A LOT of glasses from these guys.  Generally I can find what I want and get the fit right.  Prices on standard glasses are probably better than average.  Prices on progressives tend to be about average, but generally a better style selection.  My only ""complaint"" (which has nothing to do with their quality) is that as a repeat customer they email me many discount offers - but almost always on standard lenses only which (a) does me absolutely no good and (b) they should know better - I have not ordered any standard lenses in years. Even my sunglasses are now progressives.",41,25-54,M
"One star was removed for shipping length and the fact that I couldn't track my package coming all the way across the world :/ But they are very professional, everything came neatly packaged and was as described in the picture so they fit perfectly. I'm automatically addicted to this site! I'm shocked at how many brands are on here... I thought it was limited to the few that are circulated widely on the front page, but there are literally hundreds of really cool brands (some really expensive, something to look forward to when I get a 'grown-up' job someday). All in all, I am pleasantly surprised by this site. I was afraid it would be a bit hokey like some other Asian fashion sites seem to be. Only issue I can find is that this site tempts me with the idea of ordering everything!",20,15-24,F

"Tons of content, easy streaming, upload, download, subscriptions. Ads are annoying, but it's owned by Google so what do you expect? Can have everything for free.",47,25-54,M

"Been using Amazon since 1998. Very happy with shipping and return policy. Customers service (if you're unfortunate enough to need it) can be poor, but they're an online company so that's not unusual. My Prime account recently expired which has actually saved me a LOT of money. I realized I don't compulsively buy anymore, like when I had Prime.",47,25-54,M
"After a decade of frustration with other companies, I finally ""discovered"" Grainger and couldn't be happier. I used to think they just sold industrial stuff, but they've been able to fulfill almost every business need I've thrown at them. I'll update if they ever fall short (as I've come to expect from all companies) but so far they've been great. Highly recommended, as I've told all my friends.",47,25-54,M

Ordered item almost 30 days ago and a couple days later it said it's shipped but no tracking info was ever provided. Item still hasn't arrived. Fruugo says it should have arrived 7-10 days ago.

Disputing transaction with PayPal.,47,25-54,M
I was always hesitant to use Priceline because I didn't understand it. Once I took the time to read secondary reviews and understand the bidding process and the new Express deals I found a way to get an extra day of vacation in for the same price I was planning to spend for less nights. I will definitely use again.,38,25-54,F
"After adding the initial item to my cart that I was going to purchase, they presented such a huge list of free samples and discounted items on the cart page that I perused it for about a half-hour.

I have to say after reading the reviews I was hesitant to order. But I loved the shoes and boots I looked at so I did and I'm NOT sorry! I ordered my shoes on a Monday night and received an invoice the next day that explained about my order and it had a tracking number on the invoice. And 4 day later I received my shoes. They were just like the pictures and totally awesome!!!!!!!!! I love them. I will order from Amiclubwear over and over.,54,25-54,F
"This seems to be one of the only ways to get a response from infurn, so I figured I would try to make contact here. I have emailed several times an not heard back, and the phone number in the US no longer works... I ordered this table back in october and was told it could take up to 10 weeks plus an additional two weeks for processing. This means at the latest a delivery of Jan. 20. Then on the website my order is estimated to arrive in February... but no exact date. I have been patient for 15 weeks now, but this is getting a little rediculous. I would appreciate a response at the very least from the company. Back in October I informed a gentleman on the phone that the table was needed to arrive in time for a photoshoot and a party. These occur on the 11th and 16th. I was told that it would be no problem and this was ample time to process, build, ship and deliver the table... I need this table immediately... Please advise on its satus. If it does not arrive very soon, and/or if I do not recieve a response asap I will not hesitate to take this further and file reports with the BBB etc.",26,25-54,F

"My husband and I have been traveling around the world for 1 year  and we have been booking most of our hostels on hostelbookers.com.  They have the best website, the best prices for hostels, and you can trust that the places you will be staying are good based on previous travelers' reviews.  I like that you can book online at any time of the day and get an instant reservation.  There is no stress or waiting to hear back from the hostel to know if your reservation went through.  When you are traveling for an extended period of time, you want things to go quickly and easily so you can enjoy your time traveling, not be checking your email 10 times a day to see if the hostels got back to you on reservations.  The website has descriptions of facilities and photos of the hostels as well, so you know what to expect.  I also like that hostelbookers does not charge a fee, as other websites do.  Sometimes plans change.  You can get sick or you miss a bus, or maybe even your bus doesn't show up!  I don't want to lose out on a lot of money if these problems arise. Most travelers who are staying in hostels are on a budget and can't aford to pay all these extra fees.  It's good to know that hostelbookers understands the needs of travelers.",34,25-54,F

"I tried to get a reasonable deal on a ""2 Star"" Hotel near the Philly airport that Priceline in its Express Deals called similar to Holiday Inn, Best Western or Ramada Inn.  What I got was the Waterfront Inn which was a run-down, dirty, tired motel with 3 floors, no elevators, promised internet but no wireless signal, an adjoining room door with broken locks that wouldn't close completely, a room that wasn't cleaned or the towels replaced on my second night, a toilet that never stops running water, a mattress that had to have been pre WWII and to top it off - a call for help got a ""non-responsive, unable to help, try the day shift manager - maybe they can help staff"".  Avoid this place like the plague.  ONLY STAY HERE IF YOUR ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS SLEEPING IN YOUR CAR OUTSIDE A CRACK HOUSE. Did Priceline help when I called?  Not so much.  They called the night manager who could not help, had no way to reach the GM and said call back tomorrow.  So did I get another hotel until a refund could be worked out?  NO.  I'm on my own until Priceline can speak to the Hotel GM tomorrow... Now that's customer service you can be proud of!  NOT!",55,55-64,M

"I thought that I had made a HUGE mistake purchasing from partsgeek after all the poor reviews online (I didn't realize until after I had been charged). It turns out that all of my ordered items to restore my 2000 e46 328i arrived within a week, contrary to almost every rating online. The only con I have is that several items could've been packed more effectively. I had ordered 2 Bosch Headlight lenses and the cardboard package they came in was slightly dented.. nothing was damaged, however.",19,15-24,F
"Although shopping online can be difficult, due to sizing issues among the clothes (I live in the US and trying to convert the measurements to my size can be difficult), Yes-Style does their best as an international online company.

I was working a full time day job and teaching at night and on the weekends. I never had time to shop but was always in need of bras and workout clothes. They consistently provided functional, breathable, well made clothing that fits like a glove and somehow also manages to make me feel beautiful. Their online customer service and return policy for web orders is super easy. I also really love their casual clothing (especially the extra long length pants and jeans), shoes, and dresses for going out. People always ask me where I get my clothes and when I say Victoria's Secret catalog they're surprised. I guess it's kinda my secret!",40,25-54,F
"My thing with coupons is: I clip them, I put them in my wallet, and there they sit until they expire. And that's where I find them, always after I have already paid full price for the thing I needed a coupon for in the first place. This is why I love Coupon Shoebox. Because I can actually go and look for a coupon right when I  need it. I don't know how many wonderful people they have working for them but they are like Santa Claus with a bunch of elves over there. They scour the Internet and find coupon codes and then they just post them on their site. And that's it. Easy. You grab the codes and use them on whatever site you're shopping on.

I had booked a room that slept 5 people. At the time of booking it was just 2 adults and 1 child but it then changed to 3 adults and 1 child. I called customer service as a courtesy to add the 3rd adult. This would in no way change the type of room I had originally booked which slept 5 people. The customer service rep wanted to charge me more stating that when I booked the room I paid a lesser price then what the room currently went for. Why am I being charged like its a new reservation I'm simply adding a 3rd person to a room that sleeps 5? If we had been adding more people then the room slept then obviously I'd expect an up charge at the current rate to completely change the room. Not to mention that I had checked the rates just prior to calling and they were actually less than what I had originally paid. The rep continued to argue with me about the price so I had her cancel the reservation in which I have to wait for a refund. I had to re-book my reservation myself in which I ultimately paid less than when I originally booked but remember the rep was trying to charge me more. This is all around terrible customer service that instead of just assisting me and adding a name to the book she caused more of a headache. I will never use Bookit.com again and I will see that others know they will try to screw you over. Don't bother calling customer service instead do their job for them.,28,25-54,F

"To me twitter is just like a big news and gossip website, in which everybody gets to find out what other people (famous or not), organizations, TV shows, etc. do. It's just like texting, you can just write 160 characters as your status? Or maybe a picture? Really? That's why you also have a Facebook, with FB you can do all of that already, and follow people too. Twitter doesn't surprise me, is just like any other simple social media website.

One feature that some other video website have that I'd love YouTube could add is the ability to change the aspect ration of the videos played like 16:9, 4:3, etc, and an ability to ""switch on and off the lights"" of the website, while watching a video so it looks darker if you don't like putting the vids on full-screen..",22,15-24,M

"We booked our trip to Singapore, New Zealand, Australia and Bali through RWE back in january 2013. Vicki Webster dealt with all my initial requests for information extremely professionally and efficiently. She came up with a number of great suggestions and hotels to make our trip as memorable as possible. Knowing that you have someone at the end of the phone or email with a good understanding of what you are looking for made what I initially thought would  be a nightmare task into a really enjoyable experience. She spent time looking for the best hotels with the best offers to suit my families needs. There was no hard selling just great advice and help which made the decision to use RWE a no brainer. I have just returned from a fantastic month away where everything went exactly to plan. All flights, transfers and hotels were spot on.I would recommend this company to anyone looking to travel. They really do take all the stress out of planning a trip. Thank you so much...",39,25-54,F

Getting an affordable Square Trade warranty for my laptop was such a lifesaver! My laptop is over two years old and all of the sudden I couldn't type any more. The keyboard wouldn't work at all.  I remembered I had bought a 3 year warranty and got on the website and checked.  I was so happy it was still under warranty.  It was a very simple process to have my laptop repaired.  I was only without it for just over a week and that is because it was sent just before a holiday. I received it in back yesterday and it is working perfectly.  Thank you Square Trade for your excellent service.  I will definitely purchase more warranties from you in the future!,54,25-54,F
"Booked a trip to Disneyworld. They booked us through Delta with a layover in Atlanta. Our flight from Atlanta to Florida was scheduled to leave SIX minutes after our arrival in Atlanta. THANK GOD the flight was delayed, otherwise we would have missed our flight to Orlando. The shuttle service desk was closed because we arrived after midnight and the kiosk wouldn't scan our vouchers, so we had to pay $200 to get our family to the hotel, ONE WAY. The agency allowed us to book one bedroom for five people EVEN though it was against hotel policy. The hotel had to make an exception in our case because it was already booked. $15 a night for a cot. Our itinerary clearly read ""1room 2 beds for 5 people, breakfast included."" When we tried to redeem our breakfast vouchers the hotel pointed out that they only ever assign TWO breakfast vouchers per room. Something bookit was COMPLETELY unaware of. First day of vacation and I am ABSOLUTELY LIVID. The customer service representative I spoke with (after an hour of transfers and holds) was completely RUDE and CONDESCENDING. He refused to connect me to his supervisor and would not even repeat his name for me.This agency NEEDS to gather accurate information about the companies they book, present all correct information to their customers,and treat their customers with respect. DO NOT BOOK WITH BOOKITNOW. I will tell all my friends the same thing.",20,15-24,M

Their Express Deal matchmaker is a joke.

"I thoroughly enjoyed my shopping experience with shop2net. They were responsive, had a good deal on for Mass Effect 3, and kept me informed throughout. The only thing I had an issue with was the login to the website - everytime I tried to log in it did not remember me, and I had to reset my password (to the same thing) each and every time I tried to  log in to check on any news I was advised to read. That very minor issue aside, I'd definitely recommend Shop2net to a friend, and will very much be using them again. 9/10 guys.",32,25-54,M

"Good experience at check in. The car was clean and was very pleased with the location of the rental station. HOWEVER....be careful with the extras they want to charge you at the time you drop off the car. Make sure you keep the original estimated receipt. Make sure you question every item they try to charge you at the end. Other than this sneaky attempt to chage you for things you don't need, I would rent from them again. Buyer beware for sure!",37,25-54,F

If you like gaming you really need to check out what CJS can offer you. I confess I was sceptical and started slowly but now I just get the latest offers and add new stuff as an when the urge grabs me. Going to be getting in with some of the pre order stuff why not saving £10-20 on a game makes me feel good and I can get started on the day of release (sometimes earlier). You might sometimes have to wait a few hours if the stock on popular games is low but rest assured these guys are the real deal. So far saved well over £100 on games and I am hardly started. Loving gaming and I getting all my games from CJS which means I get more games for the same cash I would have paid on Origin and Steam.,51,25-54,M
Although it is a liitle disorganising which you first enter the page after you find your game and what you want the give all the instructions and allow you to find the specific details that you want in a company. After i used this i was really satisfied with the experience as its security and efficency make the process well thought out. I can find little things that i hate about the site but i find these problems in every other site as well so ive found to ignore them. All in all the site allows you to get what you want and fast with instructions all the way from start to finish. I recommend it.,24,15-24,M

"Be very very careful booking from this website. In my case they advertised one hotel but the reservation confirmation was for another lower profile cheap hotel from the same chain. Firstly the customer service guy tried to persuade me the hotel listed in the confirmation is the same one I wanted, then after realising they made a mistake on the website blamed me for misreading the advert and refused to refund in full. Next day the issue on the website was fixed and still they don't accept there was an issue. Can clearly see it on google chached pages though... The cancellation policy said I could cancel by 25 Feb when the booking was made on 27th leaving me negative amount of days to cancel... RUBBISH! Still can't get my money back!",32,25-54,F

I contacted wowcher customer service and they came back to me saying they were going to contact the seller. Weeks past but nothing happened, no responce from neither wowcher nor the seller. I tried to contact them couple more times but all my emails were ignored. Another example of poor service was recently when I couldn't book the appointment with the service provider and hence wanted to transfer the money to voucher credit. No luck contacting Wowcher customer services team.",31,25-54,F

"I was first skeptical of the website, clothes for 10.00 dollars yea right?  So I decide to make a small purchase for about 20.00 dollars. I was able to use PayPal which made me feel a little more secure I also noticed that their company is located in California so that was also comforting to know. Anyhow I made my purchase for ground standard shipping and I literally received my package in less then a week I was in awe!  The clothes is not cheap material either, its actual good clothing sometimes it wilk even be brand but the will cut off the tags because the are selling it of a major disconted price.  With that said I have ordered over 10 times and every time theres something new on The site. Not only is it majorly discounted price but you can also rack up points for simply purchasing or reviews and then you can get a discount on top of the already discounted price! I love it! I would review this website/ company a 10 star rating but since it's only 5 I'll do 5.",15,15-24,F

I ordered a few dresses with Boohoo in the sale. They arrived promptly and were exact matches to their description. I did return 2 dresses because I ordered the wrong size but the process was easy.

I would definitely use this company again!,23,15-24,F

"The clothing from here is very cute. I love this stuff, the models are cute and the prices are just right. The fabric of the clothing is soft and durable. The colors are beautiful and well schemed. Most of the styles and the designs would fit in everyday ware. I am truly honored that I have been informed of this wonderful website that my friend informed me of. I am truly grateful to be wearing these products and intend to spread the word about these stylish assets. I am not able to find these type of cloths in America, which saddens me. Even the items for the abode is truly magnificent.",17,15-24,F

I am wearing both of them right now because I couldn't decide which one to put on.  But what really sold me was that I could get them to say ""dogs"" on one and ""cats"" on the other.  I have never found a shop that had any jewelry for people that had more than one of each.  I have two dogs and three cats.  Thank you PetFlow.com.",44,25-54,F

Being a frequent traveler, this has happened several times and previously they have been great. They said as long as I returned on the same return day on my contract, I was fine. Well upon arrival, they charged me a full extra day taxes and all. I was really upset and they refused to let me off property until I paid it. I have called several times to speak to a manager and no one has ever called me back. I will NEVER park here again. FYI they did this as well to the 3 other people behind me.

The prices are lower than any other website (and if they are not they will match the other website) and the shipping is fast.,24,15-24,M
"Unacceptable, such a scam. Take me by my word, NEVER EVER TRUST THIS SITE!! They lie and swindle you out of your money. They take the amount off your card, and when you arrive to the hotel you supposedly booked, there is no reservation to be found. Considering they don't have a working phone number for you to call, you are pretty much out of luck at that point. You can email them, but they never get back to you. So, they have your money and your are left to scrape up extra cash you may not have (which was the case with my experience) to attempt to find a reasonable hotel that isn't absolutely disgusting, and are left to eat $5 Pizzas for the weekend. Thank you Olotels for ruining my vacation!",21,15-24,F

Called and was offered help by an amazing sales team who took plenty of time to call around and find the perfect diamond for me. Sent me a list of 5 or 6 he liked in my parameters and I picked one.

"I have been a Priceline customer for years now.  I use them 95% of the time when I have to travel about anywhere.  The other 5% would be from the inability to cancel or change reservations (even with the cancellation policy).  So, if there is a chance that I may have to have ANY changes made to a reservation I will not book with them.  But, that is pretty rare.  Even though now at times its a bit harder to really get REALLY good deals, they pretty much beat out there competitors prices.  Love my Priceline!",52,25-54,F

Hands down best Halloween store for costumes. I ordered three of the 1950's costumes for my kids. They have a school play in a few days. I searched every site and this place was the cheapest and very fast shipping.They absolutely loved them!

"We booked a Suntransfer vehicle for my and my husband's arrival at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. I had gone back and forth with myself over using a taxi or hiring a car service, but when a friend highly recommended Suntransfers, I decided to give it a shot. The driver was there right as we exited Customs and Immigration and we were in the car within five minutes. His English was excellent and we chatted on the way to the hotel. What I really liked about the service is that for our return trip four days later, we had the same driver.  He was extremely punctual for the return pick up as well. I would highly recommend this car service! Competitively priced compared to a taxi, the peace of mind is worth a little extra money!",64,55-64,F

Once received the part I went to install it and the transmission mount was made incorrectly and caused the bolts to cross thread into my transmission.... It was a design flaw.... Now i not only have the wrong part.... i have to have the threads re-tapped by a machinist.  I sent parts geek and ""customer support ticket"" and a explanation of my situation. The sent me an RA number with no apology and stated I am responsible for the shipping back.... After trying to contact them by phone..... ""Good Luck""!  I would wait 10 min on the phone then the the IRV stated i should fill out a ticket and submit it via internet due to heavy call volume...hummmm this has been the same response I have received all week.  I would then submit a customer support ticket....MULTIPLE times ...NO RESPONSE!  I briefly explained my situation and asked them to please call me in regards..etc. and left my contact number.

I'm not so sure about the quality since it's my first order and I haven't gotten them in my hands yet. But based on other customers' reviews, it seems they are made of good quality. Another thing that I like about YesStyle is the fact that they offer Paypal as one of their payment methods. It makes the checkout process easier and it does save time.",24,15-24,M

I tried re-encodeding the file thru a well known Encoder….no option for wmv….she was under the gun, so I cut the file in half and outputted mp4…..she tried uploading, and it took some time…so I did a search and found this product…the purchase price was affordable, so I purchased and was now able to output the file as a wmv on my Mac.

Contacted seller, sent them pic of the wipers needed. Several days later rec'd order to ship it back. Asked for pre-paid label to return item, but was told that it is my responsibility to return wrong item. Tried to call several times: no live support. Company itself assigned return authorization under ""Wrong Item Shipped"" title, but still refused to reimburse shipping. Interesting, that one email requested that I will provide them with part item number, so that can check their inventory, but these wipers are still advertised as for S-500. After this experience, I had no time to wait for another shipment from different online retailer and went to dealership to by wipers.",47,25-54,M

"I shop here often and it is rare to get anything that is sized right and doesn't look cheap. Now I do like the clothes but they are never as they appear on the site. Pants run small and shirts tend to run a bit large in my experience. I would not recommend the sweat pants at all, and sweaters are going to be thin. Anything with rhinestones I don't recommend either. Attachments on shoes like flowers may fall off, but if you have a hot glue gun.....also the jewelry is just horribly cheaply made, so...just as long as you know what to buy you are ok. I will say I have been waiting for more than a week on my last order, and when I accidentally added two of the same sweaters to my cart rather than calling or emailing to be sure it was not a mistake they sent it and told me my mistake my shipping problem, so...yeah, that was more than a 100 dollar order, and I had 2 others on the way, so I felt a bit unappreciated. I hope it was not lost or stolen, because they are not responsible for that either evidently.",38,25-54,F

The cocktail making the following day was a good laugh and we were given the full attention of the barman.

"I ordered a toilet seat which was very expensive for my children as my 4 year old son kept falling in as he is just 4.  this one was supposed to be bigger and have a wider seat as it is a ""throne"" seat.  I received it and a couple of weeks later opened it once we had some time over Christmas to fit it.  as soon as I took it out of the box it was clear it would never fit a normal toilet so I replaced it, resealed it in a box within a box marked fragile and paid for it to be retuned special delivery as requested by Fountain.  at the time I returned it, Fountain said they would have to knock off £80 as we had not returned it within 10 days and I reluctantly accepted that.  However having paid £260 for the seat and £20 for the postage, I was told by Fountain that it had arrived damaged so they would not receive it back and about 2 weeks later it was returned to me.  I have no idea how they believe that this could have occurred when the toilet seat was not even fully removed when I originally received it as I saw immediately that it was the wrong back sitting (which was never clear or stated on the website that it needed a special Victorian style toilet) and I do not believe it was damaged at my end at all, they simply did not want to refund it.  Iit was returned fully packaged, in the box, in another box and marked fragile.  I will not be back to this company.",45,25-54,F

"I've been using Priceline for years as my go-to place for travel bookings--both domestic and international. I love having the ability to bid on everything from flights, to hotels, to rental cars. I would always suggest to the user to use priceline to get a deal especially on hotels and rental cars. The flights are a little more dicey--I think that the prices can't change very much, and if you want to get somewhere at a certain time, I wouldn't suggest bidding, but just looking at the prices on the site. My tip for getting the best prices? First, check priceline's Express Deals and traditional prices after also checking Kayak and Hotwire. Then, go for the bid that's a bit below what the listed prices are. You can usually get an idea of what you may get from doing this. I've NEVER been let down by the site, and look forward to using it more and more and suggesting it to more and more people!!",31,25-54,M

I received an email today showing that my new shipment was due to ship this week. I called them to let them know that I know longer needed that order due to my puppy being put down, and explained that I hadn't even opened the last order I received. The customer service rep said they would refund my $61.00 back to my credit card, and could I please donate it to a shelter. I was so shocked, and thought this is one awesome company who cares about their customers. I highly recommend them and if I need specialty food for any of my pets this will be my first stop.

"I found Sixt via one of those Priceline type sites and went directly to the site to rent a car for a trip to the UK. When I arrived to Stansted Airport (60 minutes early) they weren't ready with a vehicle, so I had to wait for an hour. It was an annoyance, but that was ok. When they were ready, I picked up the car. They asked me if I wanted an upgrade. I've been offered free upgrades before (because of  available vehicle stock) but they never told me the cost of the upgrade. Then they literally just handed me the keys and sent me on my way. The personnel at the rental office didn't inspect the vehicle with me or give me any introduction to the car (it would have been nice for them to at least offer me a quick tutorial on how to use the GPS, since I'd never been in the car before and I'm from the USA and driving in a different country. I spent 20 minutes just figuring that out). The car itself was flawless. I returned the vehicle at the end of the trip and they charged my credit card for the rental. Sounds great, right? Great car, great price, middle of the road customer service? I can live with that, right?  Still all considering, I'd have used them again. But four days later I get a bill for ""tire damage"" for $220  via an email. I'm now in a foreign country, have no way to dispute the claim. I have no knowledge of any tire damage or any event that could have caused this damage, but I did not inspect the tires before or after renting the car, and no one inspected the car with me prior to leaving, or returning to Stansted Airport. That all considered, I decided to just pay the damage claim, write their customer service and email about my experience and move on. It's not worth my time or money to dispute it. So I responded with payment via the form they asked for and waited for them to withdrawal the money. They never withdrew the money from my account, but continue to send me reminder emails asking for payment. The last one threatening legal action, so I called the UK offices. No voicemail, and no one answering the phones. So I called the American Sixt offices. They were VERY helpful, giving me the direct email address to the person sending me the damage request emails. After sending her an email, they finally they withdrew the funds from my account. The rental ended 2-24 and this fiasco ended on 5-06. I regularly travel to the UK, and I'll never use them again. I'd be willing to try US Sixt, because they were so helpful in resolving this issue, but not in the UK. Horrible customer service, horrible experience all around",47,25-54,F

"Add my experience to another ""lost in the mail.""  After 14 days since shipping out, I looked at the tracking info and it had stalled at the main post office in San Antonio 13 days earlier.  There was no update after that and I didn't get the package.  Contacted Redbubble via their Chat feature and was told to go check at the post office.  What is this, 1950?  My neighborhood has plenty of shared mail boxes for parcel deliveries so I doubt they couldn't fit two stickers in one of them, if not my personal mailbox, and I didn't get any notice for pickup.  But they wanted me to go stand in line and ask anyway.  Then the Redbubble rep told me to give it another 5 days.  Look, the last tracking update occured 30 miles from my house 14 days ago.  I don't think 5 more days (for a total of 19 days) is going to make a difference.  But in the Redbubble universe, I guess this is how things work.  Seems like a lot of items get lost for some reason, but since they couldn't just resend my $5.00 order on the spot, I don't think they're too worried about customer retention, so I'm done with that site.",42,25-54,M

"Took them a calendaristic month to build it, although on the build page it said 9-11 days(working days). Everything else went smooth, they even dealt patiently with my anoying phone calls; It didnt feel like they had something else to do and need to hang up as others make you feel. P.S. If you build a fancy PC(like a did) dont be cheap(like i was) and pay the extra premium for 3 days build. Might feel expensive but you get you custom computer at least 3 weeks faster. :)",37,25-54,M

"Supplement Warehouse has been meeting my sports nutrition needs for something like  going on three years now. When I first started using them they had a lot of energy like a new startup - you could see it with the handful of confetti and random unexpected little gifts they'd always throw into the box with a large order. Now and then they'd send you the wrong flavor or something, and usually would make up for it by sending out a replacement and letting you keep the oops order. Nice! They've become more professional now, no confetti, and you actually select your ""gifts"" (samples) to go with your order which isn't quite as fun. But they are very dependable, extremely quick with the shipping, and have really great prices - and unlike other sites they don't advertise low prices and then ask you to make up the difference on shipping and handling charges - instead they charge the straight up actual shipping costs which are really not much, and it's usually really easy to either purchase over the threshold for free shipping or pick up an item that makes your entire order free shipping. Great merchant!",29,25-54,M

The website is now has a shortcut in my toolbar.  Instead of wasting time shopping around I will start at SupplementWarehouse.com.",34,25-54,F
Everything came how it was supposed to. I paid to have my dress shipped 6 weeks from the day I placed my order and I think it came a week or so earlier than planned!!! I would order from this site again!!!,26,25-54,F

"We found the tyres we needed online quite easily, and found the online system really easy to understand. We clicked on the appointment we wanted and within half an hour received phone call to confirm. We were told the fitter would ring half an hour before arriving, and that's exactly what he did.( When he arrived he was polite, confident and efficient. I just gave him the keys and left him to it. Soon after there was a knock on the door, I signed for the work and off he went. Very pleased indeed. We will definitely be returning to Kwik Fit!",58,55-64,F

"I want to be honest, i was really skeptical about this method, because i was scammed in the past with a similar procedure, but this method really works. I'm in Costa Rica and my AT&T locked iphone 5 was bought at the ebay site, and the simple steps that were sent 24 hours later did the work, thank you!!",43,25-54,M
"Your review: “Been looking at your website for a couple of months at a 3ft extending oak dining table. Fell in love with it but was reluctant to order it without seeing it up close. Then surprise surprise, a store opened in Poole and I went along loved it and ordered it along with a lamp table! It was delivered today after only one week! Excellent service, fantastic piece of furniture. Well done Oak Furniture Land. I will recommend you to all my friends and will be coming in for more furniture in the future.”",51,25-54,F
"Ordered fit flop boots from rubber sole, unfortunately they weren't a good fit for me. The service from rubber sole was really Good though, and returning them at one of the collect and return points was simple. Have received emails from them to let me know that they received them and am now awaiting my refund which I've been told via email will be in my account in a couple of days. The company's customer service is very good and although the item I ordered had to be returned, I will definitely be using rubber sole again.",51,25-54,F

This is a great company with great integrity.  Love their products.  I would like to see larger quantities available.  A fifteen day supply is really not enough time to gauge a product's effectiveness and you almost have to reorder immediately.  GREAT PRODUCT and GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.,46,25-54,F
"After many times being completely frustrated with the level of customer service, handling of orders, out of stock, etc. with Europa Sports, I began to search for another supplier.  I am SO GLAD that I found supplementwarehouse.com !  The selection of products is virtually unbeatable.  Their prices are definitely THE lowest, EVEN with my wholesale discount from Europa Sports.",45,25-54,F
"All arrived as ordered and with an admirable promptness. However, my name was not on the outside of the package and therefore goods inwards had no idea who the package was for so ended up opening it up. Seems a simple and small thing to put right. Maybe it was because not delivered to home address but still a thing worth correcting you folks at Suttons. T. Everitt",52,25-54,M

"I've ordered for supplement warehouse a number of times, and it's always been nothing but satisfactory! Definitely recommend",34,25-54,M
"I would say this is one of the best places you can go. They will match prices but usually are the lowest anyways. The only thing I do not like is how the shipping goes up with small (Free) items like protein bars. You literally pay for the bars with the shipping going up. Other than that, I usually go here for my supps.",25,25-54,M
Rev'.com's transcription service was pleasantly user-friendly. I can't believe I'm getting my transcriptions back so fast. I crossed checked their work by sending them one on which I had already transcribed a good portion. Their transcription was right on the money - very accurate. I think they are an excellent value and are saving me a great deal of work. I will be recommending them very highly to my colleagues.,55,55-64,M
The customer service cannot do a single thing for you. They just send your email to some supervisor who apparently responds to one Issue a day. Haven't been able to use my card in over a week. Customer service on the phone is full of apologies and no answers. Reporting you guys to the better business buro stop running the company out of your grandmothers basement.,25,25-54,M

"I recently purchased two loose diamonds from Brilliance to upgrade my wife's diamond for her engagement ring, and then to get a similar diamond to make earrings for her.  I purchased a 1.17 carat round diamond to match her old engagement ring diamond for earrings as well as a 1.75 carat round diamond for her engagement ring.  Both diamonds were EGL, D color, SI3 clarity.  I couldn't be happier with the purchase.  In total, I paid 30% less than any other diamond broker I spoke with.  My wife loves new earrings that I had made and has not taken them out.  She has received many compliments on both the earrings as well as on the engagement ring.  I will absolutely be recommending Brilliance to my buddies as well as using Brilliance for any future loose stone purchases that I make.  The customer service was informative in describing what the stones would look like.  I can say that both stones are completely colorless and look fantastic.  I'm sure that a lot of people think that I probably spent a lot of money ($20k+, when in fact I spent less than half).  The joke is on them for paying too much with diamond retailers who cannot pass savings along to their customers.",29,25-54,M
"I am 36 years old and have had three kids. I train and run for half marathons but I still carry a little extra on my tummy. This causes me no end of grief when shopping for swimwear. Because I am very short on time, I prefer to shop online when I can. I had been dealing with another leading site which I will not name ""her"" but I became so frustrated with their customer service that I decided to try someone else. I went to a number of sites and found two beautiful bikinis at Tropical Beach Swimwear. When I received them, I realized that I had ordered the wrong size for one of them and called tor return it. I was so pleasantly surprised with the customer service, the support and the patience of the women on the phone. I now not only purchase my swimwear from TBS but I also shop for dresses their too. 5 stars to you guys...Your the best.",36,25-54,F

My order for a few shorts and tees were so poorly met, I wondered on what makes them a name in business. For those who are looking to shop better, I guess FSession is actually a better choice. Although they are just about five years old, I loved the quick shipping and packaging, plus no complaints for the products sent! Honestly, I shopped so much on ASOS that I am surprised at their poor services. It’s FSession for me all the way!",24,15-24,M

"Quick review: Horace Vernet, Ballad of Leonore, 1839 by First Art Gallery. Would be Hard to distinguish this painting from the original. High quality painting completed on high quality canvas. This vendor reproduces historical paintings with oil on canvas. A true masterpiece and work of art. Order arrived fast in under a month. Packaging was solid and well made.

"On Saturday, 20th of October, I purchased a ticket for the Killers at the SECC, at Glasgow. I have yet to receive an email indicating my ticket was shipped and the gig is in three days! Unless it is posted tommorow it won't arrive on time and I paid 140£ just to be sure I woulld have a ticket no matter what! I have emailed viagogo twice, never got a response and when I called them I was told they would contact the seller and email me by the end of the day. Still no email. I am panicking since I will travel all the way from Athens to go to this gig!! OrderID: 2568688 UPDATE: Unbelievable! Have spoken to three agents so far, getting the same reply that they have to get in touch with a separate department in order to reach the seller--by email!! They have emailed me back twice with the exact same automated email on how they are working with the seller to ensure that I receive my ticket in time. They obviously never read my actual email!!!! I have never experienced worse service in my life and I have bought various tickets for concerts abroad. Steer clear.",20,15-24,F

"Drive time has taken money out of my bank account ,not once but twice. I paid $300 of my down payment on my debit card in November,they took out $300 in December 2013 and in  March 2014. The first time it took a few days to put the money back on my card. This time I have to wait on a check. Dont know why it changed. I had to go back and forth from my bank to the dealer,I got transferred from one department to the next. This happened on March 27th...it is now April 8 and I still don't have my cash. They mailed the first check to the wrong address and as of today my check is still not in the mail. I ask for the inconvenience could I get a few free car washes or maybe a gas card,the operator act like she couldn't believe her ears. No was my answer. They said this happens alot in Ohio. The dealer told me the problem was fixed in January.This is March....and I have to borrow rent money because drive time took my cash.",43,25-54,F

Pro: Best price -  Good collection - Good customer service (you have to email them) Cons: Possible delayed shipping It's my second time buying from them. They have the best prices that I could find online. You may get delayed shipping which was not a big deal for me. The first time I had no problem. I had a 400$ order. The second time I got my order in couple of weeks but one of my perfumes was missing. Email the customer service and they give said they can send the missing one or redound me. Since I was moving to a new address I chose to get redound and they sent me a company check. Overall if you are not in a hurry and want the best price they are the best.,30,25-54,M
"Great quick service, can't beat the price and convience.",52,25-54,M
The one concern I had with this company was that they had ridiculous shipping costs. But when I looked at all of the factors I realized shipping will always cost money. The amazing prices for shaker bottles and samples along with their ridiculously low prices on supplements made it all worth it. I am happy to be your new customer :),19,15-24,M

The objective ranking criteria helped us understand what to look for & what mattered vs. didn't matter. Their editors were thorough & super quick to respond. Really helpful site.",30,25-54,M

"Often Olotels has the cheapest price on comparison sites - but the actual price they display for your purchase will vary according to the links you click to get to them.  Through cashback sites like Quidco, for example, Olotels will automatically inflate the price of the room so you pay more and the cashback discount is effectively worthless. Also, always check with the hotel you're booking that they've received the Olotels reservation in their own system, saves disappointment.",60,55-64,M

I hate going to smoothie king. I have never found a clerk to be honorable kind and positive. I will never buy muscle milk or other brands that are not recognized on the protein powder circuit. Every time my family member orders here they come home with delicious protein mix. The best part about the ordering is the stages of the process. When you order it says how much is charged total. Then it makes you review the order and input card info. Very assuring that no mistakes occur. Unless you forget to check the order and you wait three wondering when the shipment will come. Happened twice(good god I'm dumb). But I like it for quickness of getting my stuff sent and no cranky morons to awkward you out of the store.,53,25-54,F

"So yeah they have a ton of dresses at low cost but they have a horrid tracking and customer service center. I was worried about when my dress would arrive as my brothers wedding was fast approaching. It took two weeks and threat to cancel my order to get a reply. I tried calling but the phone was never answered. I utilized the online chat function who told me to email a department and the email they gave me failed. When I finally got in contact with them they simply stated the same time policy as listed on the website, they said my dress was still in process and had not shipped. Then told me that it may be late due to the labor day holiday in China. To my surprise the dress arrived the same day. They did not even know it was shipped or they didn't bother looking. The quality of the dress is not so great I have seen better and it looked nothing like the website picture. The skirt also has more gathers on one side than the other making me look as if I am leaning. If I had more time I would find something else.",27,25-54,F

I needed to contact Priceline in order to add another name to my hotel reservation since I had been delayed by weather and the other person was at the hotel but couldn't be admitted to the room.  I called priceline on my cell phone to make the change and found that I needed to use a touch tone phone rather than my cell phone to navigate the menu.  I was at an airport terminal building and had to locate a touch tone phone in order to complete the call.  This makes no sense to me.  I was pressed for time and the use of my cell phone would have made the transaction much simpler and faster.  I was also talking to a non-english speaking person who never did get things right.  I needed information faxed to Circus Circus at Reno Nevada and I think it went to Las Vegas since it never reached the Reno location.,22,15-24,M

I cant say how pleased I am with my costume purchase for my last theme event. This was for a pin up/burlesque night. I decided to go as a sexy sailor. I couldn’t have asked for better service! Marsha was there to help me with sizing and the costume came super quick. I added some of my finishing touches and was a hit of the party…and my date was very pleased…couldn’t keep his hand off of me.

"I thought I had found a better deal on another pet food delivery site... and they almost had me. I found the food I was looking for at what appeared to be an unbeatable price. It was a whole $10.00 less than any other site, including PetFlow. At least, that's how it appeared until I got to the checkout. I was one click away from submitting my order when the delivery charge was first displayed. That site wanted to charge me $12.95 for shipping. I went to PetFlow where I found the same food for $10.00 more, but they only charged a flat rate shipping fee of $4.95 IF you didn't qualify for the FREE shipping. The free shipping was on orders of $49.00 or more. My order came to $48.99... which meant I didn't qualify for the free shipping. I contacted PetFlow and asked if we could work something out since I was only $0.01 short of qualifying for the free shipping. The lady I worked with gave me another code extending the free shipping to me on all repeat deliveries of the product I was ordering! In the end, PetFlow was $2.95 cheaper than the other site that, at first glance, appeared to be the best deal. PetFlow was also $3.00 cheaper than my local pet store and there was NO SALES TAX which made them a total of $6.00 cheaper than my local store! The best part was that the food arrived at my door just 2 days later! With their superior customer service and willingness to work with their customers, PetFlow turned out to be THE BEST DEAL OUT THERE!!!",35,25-54,M

Received the wrong filter the first time.  By the time I got the right part I would have been better off buying it locally because I ended paying for shipping twice.  They did refund the price of the returned part but I was still out the cost of shipping it back and the cost of shipping the first part. Not to mention the extra two week delay in between returning the first one and the second one arriving. Probably won't try that again.,70,65+,M
"This company has the worst business practice and customer service of any company I have had the displeasure of dealing with.

I was not told this up front and could not wait weeks for a pair of eyeglasses. Please do not consider buying glasses from this horrible company.",26,25-54,F

"I love how each brands have their own style. Mixing in some ridiculously uniquely cute tops from YesStyle with plain pants does the job! Although all the skinny models make me slightly self-conscious at times, the pictures give me a better idea of how it would look on an actual person - not on a mannequin. It's a bummer when an item is on backorder... takes weeks... but I'm in the freight forwarding business and YesStyle is pretty darn fast at getting these clothes to people.",25,25-54,F

"I ordered top secret nutrition's 100% whey and received a free thing of astravar. Also there are alot of free gifts that you can pick up if you want to which is awesome. the only problem is that the shipping was 13 dollars and only got more expensive with the free items you choose. If you need the item that is free then the slight increase in shipping is well worth it though. Overall, I think if you find one of the deals (like free astravar) it is well worth it. But if the price of the product is only a little bit cheaper than another site and they have free shipping then it is probably a better bet. I am going to keep my eye out for more of the deals and I can almost guaruntee I will be shopping here again",19,15-24,M

Of about a dozen tours for the two trips, there was only bad ""tour""; and it wasn't really a tour so I wouldn't blame Viator.  (That was the Hop On-Hop Off tickets in Honolulu.  Part of the problem is the horrible Honolulu traffic & the other was lack of communication regarding bus stop locations by the bus operator.)

"I purchased a Square Trade warranty on their website for my laptop. A little over a year after purchase, my laptop died. I actually took it to a local computer repair center here, just to get a diagnosis. They told me that the hard drive was defective. I then filed a claim with Square Trade. 2-3 days later, the box came in the mail that I had to send my laptop in. About 14 days later, I received my laptop back. They replaced a bunch of stuff, but not the hard drive. So I turned on my laptop and it was the same problem. I contacted SquareTrade again, and again I had to ship my laptop. So I sent it back. 10 days later I received an email stating that the issue was a software issue and software issues were not covered under the warranty. They advised me to reinstall my operating system. When I finally got my laptop back, I couldn't even turn it on. I called yet again. They stated it was a software issue. I said no, I actually had it diagnosed, and it needed a new hard drive. They then told me at this point, I would need to take it someplace local, pay for the bill out of pocket, then get reimbursed. I said, ""Absolutely not, I want a refund of the purchase price of my laptop"". Square Trade states that if they cannot fix your item, they will reimburse you the purchase price. They said they would have to have a manager call me back. I was never called back. So I called back and said I needed to speak to a manager because I was either going to get a refund, or I was going to file a report with the Better Business Bureau. After 25 minutes of being on hold, I was told I would receive a refund. I needed to send them my laptop where it would become their property, then they would send me my reimbursement through Paypal. That is exactly what happened.",43,25-54,F

"Saw this lovely dress on line at Woolworth for my great niece who will be three, and set about ordering it. I set up an account so I can either pay off instantly or pay in installments all great. I then decided to allocate a shop where I could pick up my goods (with working it is easier). Within a couple of days the parcel was delivered to my home. I then got an email saying they were dropping my goods off at the alloted shop but needed some more info off me as it was my first order. Here I am thinking I have somehow ordered it twice. After checking my account with Woolworth it only held one order but I got numerous emails saying my goods would be sent back if I didn't pick them up from the shop. After a few more days I decided to phone Woolworth's and some young man in a call centre somewhere just told me to ignore all these messages as there had been some sort of malfunction . I did as he said and heard no more until I got my email to remind me of my first payment. Overall if it had not been for this ""malfunction"" everything would have been spot on. I would say to anyone DO shop with Woolworth,you can see for yourselves the quality and price points and the different payment methods. I can only hope for you there will be no malfunctions and everything will go smoothly but hey what is life without a few hiccups. Well done Woolworth for sorting it out so quickly",56,55-64,F

I came across Snaili through my Facebook news feed and found its social integration to be fantastic. I could see who I was dealing with in advance as well as their location and anything else I would need to ""detective"" if you will before I committed to meeting up with them personally.

"I pre-ordered an item from ShopTo.net. it was supposed to be delivered today (22/11/2013) this was the release date for the order in question. I eventually contact customer services to find out there is no driver available to deliver my parcel until Monday (25/112013). What kind of incompetent delivery company doesn't have a driver available to deliver a parcel, when they had all day to do it? This is the worst delivery company I have ever dealt with. I wish I now chose TNT from ShopTo's drop down menu. Avoid like the plague, if you want to be disappointed on not getting a pre-order when you're supposed to. DPD will be getting an official complaint from me as well. Update: I did receive my order today for launch day. However, it was at around 9pm. The anticipation of setting up the Xbox One and trying it has worn off, after waiting all day for the delivery. This is the first ever time I've received a delivery this late. ShopTo should not use this company again in my opinion. This doesn't change my rating, despite I did receive the parcel eventually. I still think DPD is a joke of a delivery company, and they had all day to deliver this. You're not telling me there is only one local delivery driver in the Bolton area. I know my item was sitting in a van for hours on end because the items were at a very cold temperature. Just hope my console is fine. I have a pre-order with GAME and apparently, they use this company as well. Great, another stressful day next Friday. I'm going to contact GAME to see if I can change the courier because I'm not getting another parcel delivered by you again, and I'm willing to pay extra to use another courier. Screw you. (-_-) ,l,,",36,25-54,M
"ShopTo are a very good place to order from. They are very reliable, and all my orders have arrived the next day. I've pre-ordered a few times from them, a lot of the time pre-orders, for me have come one, or even two days early. I pre-ordered my first piece of console hardware from them. Which was the new Wii U console, it arrived a day early before the official launch day. None of my items I have ordered thus far have arrived damaged. Games are sent in jiffy bags. Items which are bigger are sent out in boxes. You don't get a receipt with your order either, so make sure you keep your email receipts for any hardware you order. The only time I have had trouble with ShopTo was, when I ordered FIFA 10, they sent me Mass Effect 3 instead. Even with that error though, I sent them the game back, and they refunded me the money, plus the postage I pad to send it back to them (I din't think they reinburst you with the postage anymore). The other reason I didn't give them 5/5 is because of their new rewards programme. You don't seem to get much back when you spend with them. You spend around £40 for a game, and you get under £1 — around 85p back I think. It seems it's not per pound you spend, unlike GAME's reward card scheme. The website is OK to use, however, say you search for Hitman for example, it will bring up other un related items as well, like MP3s. So their search could use a bit of tweaking. All in all though, ShopTo are an excellent place to order from. If you want your in-stock orders the next day, this is definitely the company to use in my opinion. Places like Amazon, Play.com, and Zavvi have gotten really slack with their delivery times as of late for me. So, I will be using ShopTo a lot more from now on.",35,25-54,M
"I've tried to contact them numerous times but have been unsuccessful. I've submitted a ticket to see what has been going on. It's almost a week since I submitted my first order, so that's one more week without my supplies.

"I have used Lintbells products, Yumega and Yumega Plus, for the last 5 years since y Border Collie started with an itchy skin.  Every time I have contacted the company they have been extremely helpful and when they changed to 500ml bottles they even helped me work out how many bottles to order (I did not want them to go out of date before I used them but wanted to take advantage of a larger volume order).  I would recommend them to anyone with animals - they are really down to earth and helpful, and interested in their customers.",51,25-54,F

I had been searching stores and the web for something unique, but everything seemed to be more of the same.  A co-worker of mine steered me toward Brilliance, and I immediately found what I had been looking for.  The detailing on the antique ring was beautiful and flawless. I couldn't order it fast enough. Customer service was great!  The production manager responded soon after ordering just to touch base and clarify what I wanted. The ring arrived just as it was pictured, and my wife loved it!",37,25-54,M

"I ordered two dresses from this website.  I was concerned about returns because I wanted to be sure I could return if I was unhappy with the fit.  They have some weird stipulations regarding returns so make sure you check on that before you purchase.  The customer service was slow at responding via email and good luck getting through on the phone.  I waited almost an hour to speak with someone that was not very friendly. My dresses came in a timely fashion but one that I bought was completely see - through and cheaply made.  It would not be a big deal if I could return it, but because it was less than like 12 dollars it was not able to be returned.  The other dress I bought was a nice fit and actually seemed to be made well.  I purchased this dress to go out in Las Vegas.  It was very cute. Within about 3 hours of wearing it the threads holding the zipper in place came apart.  So I was out having fun in Vegas and my dress was falling apart.  Very poorly put together. Disappointed in this website and products. Will not be a future consumer.",26,25-54,F

On top of that I got different answers from phone reps, which have 0 knowledge on products... Basically, this is the last time I would purchase ANYTHING at B&H. Imagine if they would screw something up like that on a product worth $7000. I'd rather put my money with Adorama, never had any problems whatsover!

Purchased this insurance plan through Square Trade for my daughters new iPod in 2011. August 2013 discovered the charging port was loose and had trouble charging.  She muscled through it... November the on/off button s stuck & she couldn't turn it off when she finally could get it charged. I called Square Trade claims department & filed a claim. I figured there was too much wrong with it for it to be covered. The technician was so kind and helpful as he guided me through the process. I printed off the per paid label that was e-mailed to me & sent it FedEx to Square Trade. 1 week later I received an e-mail stating the iPod could not be repaired & a reimbursement check (for the full purchase price) was on it's way to me in the mail. WOW they stand by their word! Thanks Square Trade! We'll be purchasing ALL our future warranties through you especially the NEW iPod we're purchasing with our replacement check!

"i bought an engagement ring from brilliance in late october.  i made the purchase online rather blindly (as i did not know too much about diamonds).  i instantly got a call from one of the girls in customer service, letting me know that she did not think the diamond i selected was a great fit for the ring.  for about 20-30 minutes, she took the time to educate me on all the standard criteria for diamonds and gave me many different options.  i picked out a diamond based on her recommendation and she literally put me on hold, called the diamond supplier, inspected the ring and got back to me within minutes.  the first time she did this, she didn't have faith in the supplier because he couldn't provide a picture and then went to the next option.  she did the same process and indicated the diamond looked and sounded good.  i made the purchase, got the ring and proposed.  my fiance accepted, but i found out i had the wrong ring size.  due to wanting to have the ring for the holidays, we took it to a jewelry shop to get resized.  everyone that looked at the ring gave it very high praises and were really impressed.  brilliance is a top notch organization and makes it really easy for those less knowledgable about jewelry.",29,25-54,M

"I have been researching my families for 24 years, and I started out doing this without a computer.  When Family Tree Maker came out this was how I started, with CD's.  I had tried another genealogy site, and was very displeased with it, so I tried Ancestry.com.  It was a whole new world opening up for me, and I have never looked back since.  Having researched information prior to the computer helped me because I knew that the information I had was correct, so it helped me to find what I was looking for on Ancestry.  I have found so much information  on my families, and I keep finding more and more as I keep researching.  I have learned to watch what I am looking at in different family trees, and I can pretty much judge if this is the correct family or not.  Having the census reports has been a huge help, as have military enlistment records and/or draft registrations.  The biggest thrill about Ancestry is being able to share photos with others, and finally getting to see what my Great-grandmother looked like.   I could never go back to the other genealogy sites because they can not hold a candle to Ancestry.  I have been contacted by many people from both my families and my late husband's families, and they have not only given us information, but the joy of finding new family members, no matter how far down the line they are.  The other great thing about Ancestry is the fact that they now have DNA testing, and it really does work.  I have been contacted by family through this process, also.  I have been researching a very long time, and I hope to continue doing so for many more years to come.  Ancestry has made it possible for me to put together something that I can pass down to my granddaughter, and she on down to her future family.  Thank you, Ancestry.",63,55-64,F

The product cost was more but the s/h cost were half. Total worked out to be about the same. The big difference, my product from VD took 3 days, SW took 9. When I asked SW about it, they gave me a run around about price matching. I didn't ask for a price match, I paid the advertised price. I think these guys are probably doing 3rd party, that's why it takes so long to process orders. If you can wait and you live close, I guess they aren't bad.",50,25-54,M
"I used to be the guy who would look to GNC for my supplements. It seemed like every time I would walk into that store they were telling me it was time to renew my fifteen dollar gold card. The thing about their ""gold card"" was that the prices on their product were so over priced that it actually made it seem like you were getting a good deal. One day, for whatever the reason, I got online just to look up some reviews for supplements and happened to stumble upon SupplementWarehouse.com. I quickly was able to use their search box to find exactly what I was looking for, and could not believe my eyes when I saw the prices that were listed for the supplements. I had never realized that I was paying up tp 30 and 40 dollars more at GNC! Not only do they have the cheapest prices, but they offer you free samples of new supplements as well as give away some that might be only a few weeks old, at no cost. I am on SupplementWarehouse at least once a month and refuse to go to any other website or store. SupplementWarehouse is hands down the best place to find the exact supplement you are looking for, and pay the lowest proce to get it.

"Having placed my order, and received an email confirming despatch four days later, the trouble really began.  There was a link in the email to track the parcel.  It said to wait 3-6 hours to track, so that Parcelforce could enter it on the system.  Three days later, still no tracking, so I call them.  No, apparently too early to do anything, and told to call back in two days.  I call back in two days.  Before I even speak staff hang up, but eventually I get through and manage to speak  to what I think was the world's rudest man.  He has no idea why I was asked to call back on Monday - tracking information can, he says. take several days to be available.  He had no explanation for why the email said the information wold be available in 3-6 hours, and I have been waiting over four days.  He then proceeded to insist that the 2-3 days it takes from despatch for delivery, should read 6 days at least.  He refused to acknowledge that the website says it takes up to 6 days for delivery (from order), and insisted this was from when it arrived in the UK - even though plainly it does not say this.  He repeatedly argued, shouted me down, spoke over me and told me if I could not understand the simple terms, perhaps a manager could explain it to me so perhaps I could understand.  He then told me I should have paid for an expedited service for delivery!  He refused to acknowledge that the six days has passed, and there is still no tracking.  He cannot say when a manager will call me, he can do nothing for me if I don't understand he said, and maybe a manager will call today, but maybe tomorrow, but they are very busy.

"My order of dried animal food arrived slashed open INSIDE the parcel (no damage to mail bag), and it was not what I needed.   I contacted Pet Supermarket to ask what to do and how to replace the order with what I did need.   I stated it was urgent as my 19 year old cat must eat a special diet for kidney disease.  I got a standard email that I would get a response within 24 hours.  This was. followed up 30 hours later with a standard email saying they were sorry for delay and would revert. After 4 days of nothing I left my complaint on the facebook wall. This got action and I got a replacement parcel swiftly.  Thank goodness because Pet Supermarket then, after 5 days, responded to my complaint to tell me the date my original order was delivered (not at all what I asked them to do and no mention of the fact I had the wrong food or a damaged parcel).  I told them this and got yet another standard email that they would respond within 24 hrs, with a follow up email stating sorry for the delay.  A week further on and I have not heard a peep. The customer services are an utter shambles.  I cannot begin to say how angry it makes you to complain about something, wait forever for a reply, and then get a standard response not at all appropriate to the complaint.  It seems you will be ok unless things go wrong.  When they go wrong, Pet Supermarket clearly have not invested any decent staff or resources to deal with things.  You will tear you hair out and give up.  The exception is the facebook service, because of course they are less than pleased to see a complaint so publicly and they manage to deal with that!!  Unfortunately for Pet Supermarket they have lost my business forever as I am still so furious that they care so little for the welfare of an old cat and their customers that they take forever to respond and then give you a standard unhelpful email, and never actually respond to the complaint.",44,25-54,F

We loved the picture on the website but the actual cushion was even more lovely to see in person.  Great communications from iflorist all the way so we knew when it was delivered too.  Highly recommended.,44,25-54,F

I think that supplement ware house if the best place to buy supplements with all of their sales and good prices and price match. I like how they offer free stuff at the end of your order to tag on.

"So, like any parent would, I allow my children to play with my Nexus 7 tablet. My son loves playing my tablet so much that he uses it more than I do - which is why when he stopped using it I knew something was wrong. I eventually found my tablet hidden in a closet whit the screen busted on it; I asked my son what happened and, as most children would reply,  he said I don't know. Eventually he fessed up to dropping it on the concrete, which proves that tablets and concrete don't make good couples. I called up SquareTrade and the process couldn't have been easier. The operator ask for the serial number, validated my information, and within a half an hour I had an email confirmation and instructions on how to send my device in. I had my Nexus back in hand within 5 days, and like an idiot, my son headed back in his hands two days after that.",40,25-54,M

"Last year I sold my home in a neighboring town and bought a new home in Lafayette, LA. I got online to research available security system options and SafeMart offered exactly what I was looking for which was a wireless system independent of a telephone land line. The only reason I had kept my land line at my old home was for the security system. SafeMart offers a variety of packages from basic to all the bells and whistles. Their online and phone support is really good and their agents are friendly and knowledgable--you will not be talking to someone in another country reading answers to your questions from a troubleshooting guide. My system was very easy to install and was pre-programmed for my specific needs. I'm able to check and arm/disarm my system from a remote on my keychain and can access my system from my smart phone (checking history of sensor events, arm/disarm, etc). I get all this along with excellent monitoring service for the price I paid before for just for monitoring and I no longer have to pay for a phone land line. I also have the option to upgrade, add sensors, cameras which can be monitored on my smart phone, outdoor sirens, etc. at any time. Everything works as advertised and their support is top notch. I highly recommend SafeMart.",62,55-64,M

"This was my first and possible last time I order... the company isn't bad, but I was un-happy with a few things...  it took forever for the package to ship out, I got the item today and everything but one I was able to keep.  I am a BBW girl and in 90% of all clothing makers I am a true 3X women as far as tops go because I have a big chest.  I orders 4 of your 3X tops and only one was actually able to fit my chest size.  The clothing description should have stated that the fit on those are smaller then usual.  It could still pass for a 3X but it woud be tight on a women who wares a 3x... it would be best  for a person who wares a 2X.  So in other words... the clothing runs on a SMALL sized of the stated size. Now, I have to ship everything, but one item back :( and the big diappointment is not only do I not get a refund for the shipping I paid to get he item, but I have to pay and not be refunded the shipping I have to pay to send the items back.  Not happy about it.",35,25-54,F

"Ordered my daughter flowers from the site and granted the price was a percentage off special, but A - the flowers didn't come in the green glass vase, B - the lily's were in the vase but un opened and 1 opened after all the flowers died (very quickly at that), C - the flower value wasn't even worth the discounted cost, forget about the regular cost, and as far as rectifying the situation, all they did was give me a $12.50 in store credit which does me absolutely no good. I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because the thought of someone even doing this on purpose sickens me. I have worked in a top 100 FTD shop so I expected a replacement arrangement or a refund. My daughter no longer lives in the area so the credit works out to nothing for me.",50,25-54,F

"Normally when I order a costume online, what I see in the picture isn't always what I receive... However, I was incredibly happy with the Lightning costume AllAnimeCosplay delivered! I had emailed a question concerning shipping, and I was answered right away (great customer service!). For what I paid, I received everything that was shown and in better quality than I'd expected. I've paid hundreds of dollars on costumes that the sellers claimed to be high quality, and what I received were ill-fitted strips of nylon or cheap plastic accessories that fell apart upon touching them... Needless to say, I spent less on this costume and am 500x happier. As soon as it came in, I immediately recommended this site to my co-worker and my sister, who are both looking for costumes as well.",20,15-24,F

"When my local gym started raising the prices of the supplements I was buying from them, I became curious as to what price others were selling the same products.  I went to GNC and checked their prices to find that they were as expensive, if not more expensive, than my local gym.  I had decided I would just buy from the gym until I ran across an advertisement for the Supplement Warehouse.  Their pricing was almost half of what both the gym and GNC were charging.  I'm no genius, (haha, I'm a lifter, remember) but I figured there had to be a catch.  However, for these prices, I was going to see for myself if it was real or not.  After my first order I was convinced I had found the real deal; even more when I got free trials of products and a Muscle and Fitness Magazine to boot.  I love this place and will continue to be a customer unless the government puts free enterprise out of business.  Let's roll entrepreneurs.  Keep America free, God fearing, and STRONG!!!!",47,25-54,M

"Have been waiting for a parcel today but  had to be at docs for 10.30 so left a card to suggest a safe place if i missed them. So I left my house at 10.20 to see courier sat outside the house in his van. Are you delivering to me? Yes he says but I am early, I can't deliver until 10.36. So can I have the parcel now? No you cant not until 10.36. What!  Excuse me are you having a laff? I said I need to be somewhere at 10.30 and need to go out, but no, would not hand over parcel. In the end when I said I need to leave now he said he would leave my parcel in a secure place, (i.e after 10.36)... so He got out his van and I showed him a place he could leave it, after 10.36, excuse me but surely my house is the most secure place to leave it, not outside... He walked past my front door to observe safe place! It was a Ps4 from currys long awaited for as Xmas present or would have told him to return the parcel was so mad... Jobsworth!",49,25-54,F

"My first purchase was an adorable pink fur hoodie that I got for dirt cheap, the status was will ship within 1-2 days and I got it 5 days later, no complaints, it was even packaged nice and professional. I seen the same hoodie on other websites for triple the price of yesstyle. I will be buying from there again! Ive read a lot of bad reviews, but with buying anything from another country, you have to make smart decisions no matter how appealing an item is, if it is listed as 7-14 days, then of course it's going to take longer to ship. As a tip for anyone buying from yesstyle, I would say always buy items ready to be shipped and don't buy any items with too many accents as those may not come attached. The quality of my hoodie is way better than what i paid for. I paid about 20$ with cheap shipping and I have worn it plenty and it seems to be fine. I would recommend yesstyle to anyone who wants really cute, unique clothes for a good price.",20,15-24,F

The good: 1) the clothes are terrific and I love them. 2) all problems were ultimately resolved 3) great discounts/shipping to the US The bad: 1) I had 2 size mis-shipments that needed to be returned 2) they lost/never processed one of my orders even though I received an email order confirmation 3) It was impossible to contact them either via email or through their online contact form. Ultimately I resorted to faxing them. 4) communication was sparse and a bit nerve-wracking. All that said, I will continue to shop with them because the quality of product is so superior and the problems were ultimately resolved. Were they to improve their customer-service communication I'd be thrilled.",41,25-54,M

That amount of influence you have over the internet is directly proportional and related to how many twitter followers you have. Bigger influence means more clients, more sales and increased profits in the ultimate which is the target of every business. The normal traditional business is still prevalent and more sophisticated at the moment as businesses try to outsmart each other in terms of the number of twitter followers. All the techniques and strategies are applied and you are free to buy twitter followers to increase your business following. You may as well buy the followers but the trick is very simple as you will learn after reading the following few paragraphs There are several companies which the twitter followers are ‘purchased’;  just type the words ‘buy more twitter followers’ in your browser and you will be offered several to choose from. You must go further and establish the legitimacy of any company before you enter in to any deal because you may be scammed. This is an expensive venture and some companies charge up to and even more than $ 700 for every 4,000 followers.  Others charge $ 500 for 10,000 followers so you should compare the various companies and select that which charges reasonable prices. You should read the profile of every company to see how many followers it is capable of generating within certain duration. This therefore means that you should not just select the cheapest priced one because it may not be capable of generating g the desired number of followers at all or within the desired time frame. To get anything of value, you must be prepared to spend. It may be seen as expensive to get more twitter followers, but it pays in the ultimate with increased traffic you your website, increased sales and generally and becoming more popular and familiar online.

"I am from the states myself and it sounds a bit to good to be true, since the game I got was about 30 dollars under the origin store and it had the extra dlc with it. I had been warned not to trust sites like this and had been expecting a scam which is why I used paypal. Moneybooker doesn't get involved with disputes. But it all worked out without any issues, went from payment to 3 mins later having my key. It worked on origin and I am downloading the game now. I am now very temped to use them again to avoid paying 60 dollars a game, since this one only cost me 30ish.",33,25-54,M
"I had to order a dress for a wedding I was invited to and since my local stores very have anything that fits nicely or is my style, I went to Yes Style's website. I found a an amazing dress that fits perfectly and matches my style along with a purse to match it. Both of the items were high quality and different break my wallet. I'm really happy with both of them. As for shipping i had to wait 2 weeks but it was stated on the website ahead of time before I ordered it so I was fine with waiting. This is also my most favorite clothing store now.",27,25-54,F

"I have emailed back and forth with Smartbuyglasses several times.  I have asked on numerous occasions for them to call me, and have provided both my order id and my full contact info.  I even emailed the servicemanager@smartbuyglasses.com address, and still have not received a phone call.  I have had a similar problem as the majority of the poor reviews.  The glasses I ordered were out of stock in the warehouse, and they were checking with the supplier,  but they suggested that I choose a different pair.  I sent an email saying that if the original frames I wanted were not available from the supplier, then I would like to switch to a different frame.  After no response for 2 days, i checked my order status. It said the stock of my original pair had been confirmed.  Whew.  Then I got an email from them saying that the back up pair I ordered were not in stock, but are through the supplier. Wait...what?  So I immediately went back to my order status page.  They have now added the second pair of glasses to my order.  They have not charged me for them yet, but my total on the website has changed to show charges for both pairs.  I understand the wait time, but I still have not received my glasses, nor a phone call to straighten everything out.  I cannot even get a straight answer form the famed ""<private data removed>"" who seems to be the only rep they have.  All I want is to have my original order, and a phone call.",28,25-54,F

"I think Agoda is the real deal, prices are reasonable, but when traveling to other countries than the US, you MUST realize they charge per person and not per night which wasn't clear on Agoda's site. Ie, it states,"" max, 2 people can stay in this room.."" so you book it, tell it the number of nights, and voila, you pay and wait for the confirmation. I looked at the email confirmation, it stated one adult, but max 2 people can stay in this room, so I didn't think it was a problem, well, I even chose the ""2 person icon"" when purchasing the room because it gives you no option on how many person can stay in the room, other than you can pick max 1 or max 2, etc.. so naturally i picked 2. I didn't think anything of it when I received the confirmation and when I arrived in Kyoto, it was a nightmare, and even though the Japanese are excellent in customer service, the one thin you must know is they don't bend any rules. Long story short, we ended up cancelling the room as they tried to charge us triple the price of Agoada's site and we booked with another hotel. In the meantime, Agoda states they will refund the amount, and it's been 4 days, haven't seen the refund yet... I also didn't like the fact the reps were not native English speakers, either Indian, or Thai. This is very frustrating when you are traveling, stressed for time, trying to cancel a room, and calling overseas (thailand is the customer service number you have to call), and you can't understand what they are saying just makes the whole traveling process stressful.",37,25-54,F

Courier delivered order: one pair as ordered, the other completely wrong.  When I rang customer services they were very rude and unhelpful.  Escalated the problem to Head Office.  Cannot believe this - they will not send a courier with a replacement pair and take the WRONG pair away.  They want me to take the curtains back to one of their stores (nearest shope 30 miles away) or post them back to them via Royal Mail (quite a heavy parcel to carry).  THIS IS NOT MY ERROR DEBENHAMS - IT'S YOURS.  Don't see why I have to inconvenience myself because of YOUR mistake.  Amazon can manage it! BE WARNED.  DON'T SHOP ONLINE AT DEBENHAMS.

It gives me energy without the jitters, I'm getting all the good benefits of Green Tea without running to the bathroom every 5 minutes, and I just have to swallow 1 pill--Perfect! Plus, I've lost a couple of pounds without doing anything (I'm not overweight but did have a little roll that has now disappeared!) ...I guess this is supposed to burn extra fat but I really wanted it for the energy, but I got all the benefits.  I had some questions before I bought it and the SportsFood people where very helpful, quick and thorough. Great company that is really responsive to the customer.",60,55-64,F

A local repair place, gophermods, fixed my phone in 45 minutes, it looks like the day I got it!  I scanned and emailed my receipt to square trade and got a check in a week, no bs or extra questions or trying to get out of paying the way a typical insurance company would, just the check.

This had potential for serious consequences to me and I asked her verbally not to change it nicely but she did it anyway. After I spoke to mgt someone changed it back.

They have changed! This is what happened: I am planning a vacation in the UK and I wanted to stay in London for 2 nights. I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights at Tune Hotel - Paddington. Later that day I found out Expedia over charged me by $229, plus, Expedia charged a $25 fee for each room each night. The Tune Hotel website charged less. So, I thought I would take advantage of the ""Best Price Guarantee"". I called them up and my booking matched all the criteria accept the Tune website did not covert British Pounds to US Dollars. They would not cancel my booking either. So, I'm out $229! Travelers beware! Expedia wants to rip you off! Never book a hotel with them without researching your choice thoroughly before hand!

"I’m John from Georgia and I never thought I’d marry a Russian girl. I always thought American girls are best in the world but after meeting Anna, I must say that I was wrong. We met over an internet marriage agency “Nadezhda”; we used to talk over chat for hours and right after a couple of weeks of knowing her, I was certain that she was the one for me. I went to meet her few months back in Russian and all those time I felt like I was flying. We married in her home town and here also we had a small reception. Thanks Nadezhda. I couldn’t tell you how much I appreciate you guys.",26,25-54,M

I would recommend brilliance.com to anyone looking for a loose diamond.,37,25-54,M
I have had coverage on electronics through the places I have purchased them in the past and have had the hassle of it's not covered for that or we cant find you in our system. When I came across SquareTrade I bought the coverage not knowing how they were. I bought it because it was very inexpensive. To register my purchase on;ine with SquareTrade was so simple. Then it happened....I had to file a claim....That was easy too. It was covered. They emailed me a shipping label. I boxed up the covered item and mailed it out and bam...I received the amount of the covered item and purchased a new one. couldn't have been any easier. Now I only use SquareTrade to cover all my electronic purchases.Thanx SquareTrade.,45,25-54,M

They have amazingly low prices and if you somehow find your item cheaper on somewhere else, SW will match then beat that price by 5%; they show you how important your are as a customer to them whereas other sites basically say pay our price or go elsewhere. Some people complain about the shipping costs, but SW offers a ton of free items, samples and magazine subscriptions, so it balances. I am a 110% satisfied customer of SupplementWarehouse and will continue to do business with them, for as long as they are around. Thank you Supplement Warehouse for allowing me to afford my supplements and reach my fitness goals.",28,25-54,M

But I have found the solution, online shopping, but me being the ever so fussy person I am, finding a site with good clothing where literally impossible, until i found yesstyle! Not that I have anything western clothings, but they are usually designed for tall people, and little midget me always looks retarded wearing them, but yesstyle has asian clothings, and good ones too, that make me look cute, exactly my style. And ever since I found it, I brought a range of things from clothes, circle lens contacts and even wigs!!

No authorisation process or acceptance process it appears to be immediate and is astronomical prices!! £10 for 3 days access and immediately added to your mobile bill!!

When a key is bought for an Origin game (Battlefield 4 in this example) The code given is written in big letters; example: 2FRS-3F3T-4GGH-6HJ2-2X2R Origin will though not accept a copy pase of this, as Origin demands it be written in small letters instead of capital. This is a minor note, and not so bad (but I can't really give you 4.9), but it would be very nice if we could simply copy and paste directly from the Go2Arena key site, instead of having to write it ourselves.",19,15-24,M

"I did a lot of searching online for loose diamonds and Brilliance was definitely the easiest site to navigate and get the information I was looking for.   Specifications for each diamond are presented well and it is easy to compare diamonds on-site.  I am moderately educated on diamonds and I found one that met all of the specifications I was looking for, but it seemed a little underpriced.  It was GIA certified and Brilliance has a return policy so I decided to go for it.  The diamond shipped quickly to my local FedEx Office and I took it immediately to a professional to have it checked out.  Turns out the diamond was exactly as advertised, which means I got a great deal.  That's not to say every diamond on Brilliance is a steal.  This particular one was even cheaper than others on Brilliance with similar specs, and I'll probably never know why I got the price I did.  Still, I did a lot of shopping on other sites and in person at jewelers and prices on Brilliance are certainly competitive.  I also received phone calls from Brilliance every step of the way letting me know what was going on (that they had received the diamond from the cutter, had shipped the diamond, etc.)Combine the pricing and customer service with the great website and I would recommend Brilliance to anyone.",26,25-54,M

"Booking through priceline has been great. I used to use hotwire, but recently had much better luck with Priceline, so barely use hotwire anymore. Just beware of few things that priceline won't tell  you when booking with ""express deals"" and ""name your own price"": Resort Fees and Parking. Those can add up (in a recent trip between Resort and parking fee, it added up $50 a day. Check hotels in the same area and star level to have an idea about the practice and how much you expect to pay.",32,25-54,M
"I've ordered with xxcycle twice: both times the order was shipped the same day and took a week to get from France to Canada, which I consider pretty good - have in mind that  I've just paid around $20 for the shipment and as usual it needs custom review. You have faster and more expensive shipping options, but considering the slow step is Canada Customs and Canada Post, i do not think it's worth. Anyway, given the no-hassle service I had both times, I wouldn't hesitate ordering with them again if they keep good prices and low cost and fast shipping options.",32,25-54,M

they always have the best deals and rates on products! also usually have great freebies and their customer service is awesome.

I had a customer service question which I asked in the appropriate section of the website.  I did not receive any correspondence from you and have since purchased from another website. Not impressive.,27,25-54,F
"I really liked PetFlow at first and was recommending it to everyone. I had 3 friends sign up (for $150 bonus to me), but since they never scheduled a shipment I never got the bonus anyway so that was kind of disappointing, but I guess I can't blame PetFlow. As for the shipments, it was a bit difficult for me to balance the shipments to include only the things I needed more of, but it was still cheaper and saved me a trip to the store. Then a problem arose when I was told they were out of my cat food and it would not be included in the shipment so I went to the store and bought cat food. Then it turned out that the cat food WAS included in my shipment after all. I don't have the money (nor the storage space!) to buy more cat food than I need. So if they are out of something they should send it out when they get it in rather than telling me I'll have to wait until the next shipment so I have to buy it at the store. Then another time I happened to check on my scheduled shipment and found the prices has gone up so much that I could get the same items for $20 less at the local pet supply store. That's worth driving to the store for sure. So I've given up on PetFlow. With a little research I can find the items I need online at good prices with free shipping or I take advantage of the sales at my local pet supply store.",48,25-54,F
"I tried Mr. Chewy for the first time last month after I got fed up with PetFlow. Mr. Chewy has great prices and all the items I need for my 3 dogs and 2 cats. My first shipment arrived two days later!!! I haven't been a member long enough to see how the autoshipments work out, but after my bad experience with PetFlow raising their prices substantially, I would advise everyone to continually check the prices to make sure they are still reasonable. So far so good with Mr. Chewy!",48,25-54,F

"The bus tour saved us from walking around in the snow to see the sights. We hopped off and on right at the front door of all the sights we wanted to see. I liked the headphone tour better than the guided tour only becasue there were a few rude girls on the bus who talked and laughed during the commentary which made it difficult to hear. I thought I would like the other bus better becasue I use hearing aids which make using earbuds difficult. Great way to see the BiG SIGHTS in London! Nice descriptions of the sights, too.",59,55-64,F

About 2 months ago I met a friend who purchased new glasses with the help of her friend in a different city, I liked the frame- so I asked if she can order the same for me. She promised at first, but didn't keep her promise later, so I asked her for a brand name and number on the frame and..googled it ! That's how I discovered www.SmartBuyGlasses!

After reading several reviews about Truffleshuffle I feel I may have been unlucky in my experience. I ordered a Big bang 'Bazinga' t-shirt for my other half for his birthday. I wanted next day delivery which cost me £7.95 only to not recieve it until 3 days had passed. My tracking number didnt work either. I spoke to a customer service assistant on the phone and she did apologise and assured me she would chase it up and refund my P&P. She was very efficent and polite which helped to diffuse the situation however when the item was recieved the little sweet enclosed had obviously warmed through the delivery and had melted onto the tshirt itself. I managed to remove the stain however felt quite exhausted with the whole situation. I won't be ordering from truffleshuffle again however the staff that I spoke to were very helpful and efficient I just felt let down with the delivery and the product. Its is a great fit otherwise and my other half loved the present (thank god!).,24,15-24,F
"Before using RushMyPassport, like many online users, I perused the reviews. Many were good but there were also ""horror stories"" on some sites. In every case, the ""horror story"" involves stupidity and a lack of research into the passport process on the part of the customer, not any fault with RushMyPassport. The most common complaint is that the local passport acceptance agency makes them ""wait 2 weeks for an appointment to seal the documents for RMP.com"" - well people, don't you think you should have checked that out first? Your local post office being inefficient isn't RMP.com's fault! So when I decided to purchase this service, I had an appointment at my local office (and all my documentation ready). My case manager Terry Price did a fine job, emailed everything I needed including a FedEx label, had the passport app sealed, sent to RMP. Three days later I had my passport, I couldn't be happier.",29,25-54,M

Second time i've used them now and you just can't beat the prices. Normally download versions of a game lets face it often get priced at RRP while on amazon you could get £5 off. Here I was getting Devil May Cry for £18 a few days after release! Today I got Aliens Colonial marines for £25 a real bargain activates normally on steam and voila it's nice and secure ready to play in my steam library. I'm sure there are some sites out there which are dodgey however so far I've yet to be dissapointed with the service CJS provides.,30,25-54,M
"I would definitely recommend this website to unlock the iphone, but the time needed to unlock it is way off.

And I like that you can pay with paypal because that just makes everything much more easy. The procedure to get my key was easy and went very very fast. Awesome site where you can buy keys for a very good price 24/7, I have been to other sites where they mail you the key and i takes like 2 hours before you get your key and it's very expensive. But this store is nothing like that! It's fast, has good prices and good games for sale! 5+ stars! - Couldn't be more good than it is!",16,15-24,M

"We have used another company for 19 years.  They have not been the least bit helpful in expanding service to our new shop addition.  Smith not only sent out a professional installer, but gave us a good break on the cost of new equipment.  Everyone I have dealt with has been very professional and concerned about what WE wanted to do as opposed to ""This is how it is, take it or leave it"".  I highly recommend these folks.  You won't be disappointed.",59,55-64,F

"I've ordered from this company for the past 6 years and have not had one problem. I contacted them when I couldn't find a product and they helped me out quickly through email. I don't like phones. I fear the automated secretary. Email was responded to quickly and with a convenient link. The service is fast, directly to my door and always in two days whether I lived in Alabama, California or Georgia. Recently, I've learned that they keep me up to date on pet food recalls through emails and don't have excess emails for advertisements. I would not know about recalls otherwise and if they advertised I would not know when the emails are important. I have no complains and all praise for Petflow.com.",37,25-54,F
"I ordered batteries, a solar recharger with internal battery, and a mini lanyard with a clip. The order came within days. I was expecting it the following week but I think it was two or three days later it was on my doorstep. I am so happy I don't have to go buy batteries for my camera every week or less. It was getting rather expensive, but now that I have awesome batteries, I know I am good for at least a year or better and it's even cheaper than if I continued to purchase batteries for the next month. Everything works wonderfully and I will definitely look for something else to purchase knowing PhotonLight.com is a quality company. I've been looking for a recharger with it's own battery for years, but I didn't have any luck until I accidentally browsed across this gem and at a grand discount no doubt. Thank You PhotonLight",36,25-54,F

"Check this out before you buy from these guys! These prices are, well, literally unbeatable since they price match, which is heaven but when I got to the shopping cart I saw all of these offers for supposedly free items such as shaker bottles and headphones.  Luckily I knew my shipping before I added these items because the shipping went up by 5 dollars for each of the ""free"" items I picked.  I was pretty bummed that the site scams us like that.",34,25-54,M
"I am currently deployed and have used this site multiple times. I get my products quicker than I get packages from home! I have even been able to get a couple others in my unit to use the site as well. Most places do not even offer APO shipping, the products and prices are uncomparable. Even with the shipping prices being what they are, they are still cheaper than not being able to get quality products shipped over here while deployed.",29,25-54,M
"Bought a camera, sandisk 16GB and a camera case (X'mas promotion one package) Price £292.97 - Brilliant !! Wrapped the present for hubby, he loves it.

Went back after our holiday to Ireland and guest WHAT !! They charged me an extra £6.00 pounds to have the RIGHT CASE when it was suppose to be a package! What a FRAUD!!

"The initial order and delivery were perfect. Fast and efficient. Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ended. One of the set of two taps I ordered was faulty. I only found this out when I came to fit it a couple of days later so I had to get a replacement locally or go without a sink and bath until a replacement arrived. Good job I did! They requested a photo of the faulty item before they would do anything. A week after I sent the photo I called : ""We'll look into it"" they said. After another week I chased. 3 days, nothing. So I issued an ultimatum.  Get it sorted by the end of the week or I call my card company. 2 days later I get an email thanking me for my purchase, they are sending a replacement! Within seconds I emailed my contact to say no, just let me send it back for a refund. It's been two days and I've once again heard nothing. Poor show betterbathrooms.com The saga continues. Last email I sent them was 9 days ago, still no returns number. So yes betterbathrooms, someone is dealing with my problem, very very slowly, maybe...",29,25-54,M

We also had a problem with the courier Jay Transport in Highbridge, Somerset who refused to release the items form their depot even after telling us to go there are pick them up.",40,25-54,M

"Having used James Villas 5 years in succession, I would feel disloyal using a competitor, we've recently returned from Cyprus (5th year) Coral Bay and would recommend James everytime, they offer professional service and an excellent choice of villas in all resorts. Can't wait till next year, and will probably be Cyprus again. Thanks for making our holidays a home from home experience Gill in Sunderland",31,25-54,F

"Placed order nearly 2 weeks before Christmas and the date keeps changing. It is Christmas Eve today and now my package says expected delivery in 3 more days, Dec 27, not cool cuz this was a Christmas gift. Talked to service rep and she said nothing she could do so I called back to the ""corporate office"" 2 minutes later and the exact person answered the phone, must've been a speedy promotion. Shame on you...all in all, after leaving her supervisor a voice message, as she was off of course, I also contacted customer service thru email...I was given a code for 5% on my NEXT order!!! Geez, don't break the bank! Extremely disappointed! I do understand that this is not entirely SW's fault as my ordered had been transferred to FEDEX on the 17th, but if they are going to continue to use FEDEX then I will hold them accountable for it taking me several weeks to receive my order, especially when my checking account had been charged immediately.  I will gladly pay a few more dollars next time at GNC to have product in hand when they have my hard earned $ in theirs",41,25-54,M
Supplement Warehouse always has the lowest prices than any other place I could ever find.  Over the past couple years I have always ordered from them and never had one issue.  There is no reason I would ever stop using them. Thanks Supplement Warehouse,19,15-24,M
You can't beat the prices at supplement warehouse and I always get my order delivered to my house within a couple days.  They're the only company I buy my supps from.,45,25-54,M

So I tried Keys2iphone and they had my phone unlocked within one day, although i didn't receive the official email until after 4 days.

I will definitely recommend to others and use for any other unlocking needs i may have.",21,15-24,F

"I spent two months studying English with Kaplan in London and it was a marvellous experience! Every staff member I encountered was courteous, helpful and smiling. They have got a brilliant team of teachers, whose are always improving the classes according to the students request, the classes are very interesting, capable to catch anyone's attention! Another positive point are the cultural activities that they offer, such as visiting museums, guided walk tour at the city. If I decide to study english in a foreign country one more time I would certainly go to Kaplan International Leicester Square.",26,25-54,M

"I recently got back into Model Railroading and have been buying most of my supplies on the internet.  I found Hobby Linc and noted they have good prices so over the past 6 months I have spent well over $3,000. on their site without a problem.  On my most recent order I received my shipment and 1 item was noted to be broken in the package and another one was not in a package but loose in the Box with the package opened and left in the box... there were also parts Missing.  I contacted the company and I was told since I did not pay for insurance I could return the items, but I would have to pay for shipping?  I told them the Box the items arrived in was not damaged and therefore insurance would not have covered it... the Items were shipped in a damaged state.  I was told that if you did not pay for insurance then they did not pay for the return even if it is their fault.   I questioned them about this and I was told I would have to deal with the manufacturer for the Item that was received damaged in the Box.   I asked why it was my responsibility to deal with the manufacturer if Hobby Linc sent out damaged goods to begin with?   I was told that was their policy.   I pointed out that their ""policy"" allowed them to put items they had on hand that were damaged in their warehouse into a box going to a customer and them have the customer deal with their damaged items ! When I emailed them about the Missing parts and asked that if theyt  could at least send the missing parts !   I never  received and answer to that email. Buyer Beware !!!  the prices are good but if anything is damaged when received good luck getting it taken care of.   It appears that Hobby Lincs has 5 Star reviews from everyone that orders from them provided they do not have any damage to their order.  However, everyone that has had problems with their order gives them a one star review....  Isn't that interesting. I told them their Policy needs some rethinking and told them they just lost a good customer",62,55-64,M
"Okay, it's not selling the sexiest stuff but hey I needed a to store my winter duvet and it was good value and does the job. Sadly, I've had to take back out of the cupboard as this stupid country is freezing cold again! Bring on the summer.",38,25-54,M
Simple idea. Kinda wondering why no-one's done it before. They've got all the stuff you want to search and it's nicely arranged and displayed. Reminds me of Trulia in the States a bit. Nice idea.,37,25-54,M
"Love the idea, beautiful website, great holidays on there. Also, the lady in their TV ads is HOT.",37,25-54,M
"Chucked them a bunch of stuff. Some they junked but they got my approval first having told me it was worthless - fair enough, they're the ones in the know and at least I didn't have to take it to the dump myself - but they got me a great price for my panasonic 50"" plasma. Nice one. Recommended.",37,25-54,M

I have bought and enjoyed the good prices from this website but for some reason I took them a WHOLE week before sending me a tracking number for an order. And that without any apologies without even letting me know. So apparently I was supposed to know that an order takes a whole week to be processed before being shipped! I was supposed to start a workout now i'm starting in without any supplement. Maybe I should look elsewhere now,30,25-54,M
"I placed my order on Sunday night and I just got the email that the ordered shipped late Thursday night.  Four days to ship the product out,  they have been faster on this.  Next time I will use Amazon,  found out they had it for the same price plus I get two day free shipping with my prime account.",39,25-54,M
"The selection is immense.  You get what you order (and mine has always come well before the time they allow!)  Can't comment on customer service because not once have I ever had to utilize it.

You simply can't beat PlanetCDRom.com.",44,25-54,F
"I am always happy how much you can save on supplements on this site, but it took 2 weeks to even ship out my $300 order, and I didn't receive it for another 2 weeks.  It is vitally important to ship out APO orders as soon as possible, because after it ships it takes at least 1 to 2 weeks more than domestic orders to get to its destination.  Plus, spending that much should qualify for free shipping as well.",32,25-54,M
"I'd made a mistake on my parcel details and was panicking big time, but Samantha at P2G (the customer service advisor) helped me sort out the mistake and also put my mind at rest by checking the details of all the other parcels that I had booked.

"I did write a longer review, but Trustpilot made me go to another page to click terms and agreements blahlblah and deleted my review.  So to sum it up, Zavvi is a great site with excellent prices, particularly on Blu Rays.

"This website is brilliant, the search engine and filters work well and listening to music on the virtual deck is quick and intuitive.

Shipping is always fast and my orders have always been correct.  You can't beat the prices either.,27,25-54,M
"This has been my go-to website for great outfit ideas. Their prices are incredibly reasonable for unique styles. Only complaint is that sometimes I struggle with the one-size-fits all that permeates most of the clothing which for a 5'4"" curvy American can be a bit tough, and even OrangeBear which appeals to the ""bigger girl"" is too big for me. It takes a bit of hunting and gambling to find something that fits. But the selection is huge, so I can always find something!",19,15-24,F
"Only issue I'm having now is it isn't very intuitive how you save where you are in each lesson.  I finally found the bookmark yesterday and now today it's not there?? Plus what's up with giving yourself the percentage of complete?  I would think your system could automatically calculate the percentage based on how much of the video you actually watched...and then automatically save the point where you stop for when you return to the lesson.  Every time I try to go back I end up at the beginning.  Maybe I'm not doing it correctly, but again I say not very intuitive...",62,55-64,M

I have a friend who is very particular about what he wants when I comes to his supplements. He only likes certain brands and sometimes he cant find them by going to different stores. I have been able to find everything that he likes and so much more. They are incredibly reasonable in price (compared to the hundreds of dollars you spend in-store) and their search engine is east to use! 5 stars in my book.,21,15-24,F
Been using this site for years. Lowest rates and prompt shipping more than make up for the moderate shipping prices.,27,25-54,M

"First time user of this site, actually stumbled on them by searching on NOW energy bars.  I went first to Amazon as one of my favorites and free shipping. But after comparing - Supplementwarehouse offered a 30 pack for less then $30, about the same price others wanted for 12 bars.  I balked some at the shipping but comparing further i was still ahead - and had some free merchandise as well.",51,25-54,M
I have been buying all of my supplements here for the last 8 months or so. Everything has been great and the price match guarantee is awesome@,27,25-54,M
"When I first tried the Duplex Pillow my initial thought was that it was hard. Since my entire life has been spent sleeping on normal, soft pillows I thought I must give this new way a try, especially after reading about the benefits. The first night was an adjustment (it felt so different), but I did feel in the morning that I spent less time readjusting throughout the night than normal and I seemed to stay more in the same position. The second night was much better. I noticed a real difference when I brought my old pillow back to try. I can clearly feel how my head and chin drop on the soft pillow. The hull filling from the Duplex Pillow fills in around my neck and chin to keep my head in alignment and the pillow holds its shape all night. I like that I can just move my head on the Duplex Pillow to get my head comfortable on the hull filling, but that it still retains its shape to keep my neck aligned. I found that I did prefer the buckwheat side at the bottom for firmness and the millet side on top for softness.",45,25-54,F
"The quality of the wig was a little lower than I'd hoped for, it needs a thorough combing out (and there's a lot of hair in a Rapunzel wig!), but I don't think that's the vendors fault. More likely the fault of the manufacturer.",45,25-54,F
i needed my passport renewed asap and they helped me with little hassle!  i am at the airport now with my trusty passport in hand.. i live somewhat in the middle of nowhere and my specialist james rosier called me and made sure i could get it in the most efficient way possible and his estimations on arrival were spot on!! i would 100% refer this company to anyone!,27,25-54,F
"UPDATE>>>>>>> AGODA's customer service specialist replied promptly to me. They sent a kind letter and they amend my booking to which i aimed for. i accepted the amendment. i am only concerned to the package mistake, No other intention. I highly appreciate Agoda's effort to make customer satisfied. i will continue to use their service. Next time use screenshot for all online transaction. I also thank Fullerton, very responsive and cooperative to customer's issue. Thank you for all. ************************************************************************** Last night i booked Fullerton Hotel for my january 2013 trip. i booked promo called ""irresistable courtyard"" which includes breakfast and free internet access. Before buying, i compare with wotif.com ; asiatravel.com and also Fullerton hotel website. They all have same promotions. I decided to buy from agoda because i am interested in their reward program. i bought several times before with asiatravel and also wotif.com. But, when i received a confirmation letter, it said i booked the room in Fullerton which not include breakfast (which has HIGHER RATE!!!) Last night before i made booking, i counted several times comparing these four websites, i know which i was booking. Would i buy room which more expensive and without breakfast??? i wrote a letter to Agoda asking them to make amend, They said they couldn't and insist that i made the more expensive booking and without breakfast. it is also non refundable, they won't change a thing!!! i am so so dissapointed :( Please don't cheat me, Agoda!!!",41,25-54,F

Really impressed by the range and value compared to other online companies.  The photos are really well presented so you know exactly what you are getting.  A free card is a nice touch and free delivery at the weekend is even better.,32,25-54,M
"I was very happy to receive my RAB summit jacket from the outdoor shop, but when it arrived it looked grubby/dirty. I phoned the shop immediately to inform them and they said that it may be the down feathers showing through the jacket. Fair enough, but a little strange that no one noticed before sending it out. Anyway, arranged to return the item in exchange for a replacement (different colour) and was told that this would be a 'goodwill gesture' and that I would not get a refund on my postage. As the jacket was worth £190 I had to send it special delivery at a cost of £10! The new jacket has arrived and I am pleased with it, although I have a bit of a sour taste in my mouth that they sent me a substandard item to start with then I had to fork out to send it back and get it changed.",31,25-54,M

"Yesstyle is simply an amazing site. It is very hard to find the asian style clothing in US, or europe. But what IS the asian style clothing?  There are alot of styles on the site, but my favorite is the cute and feminine clothing, what makes it the best is that the prices are also affordable. The weekly deals are a real pain for the wallet! They are irresistible! With sales from 10%~70%, you can't go wrong. When I ordered from the site I noticed that the shipping is from high quality. The price varies for countries, but is surely very cheap considering that you get insurance and tracking and probably for most of the best, you get a really fast shipping! Aswell do they have extra sales for the people who order alot of things from the store, which makes them want to stay even more!  Overall: this site has everything you want, its trustable, its reliable, it has multiple styles so everyone can shop on it, and its easy!",17,15-24,F
Would highly recommend these - small but functional!,42,25-54,F
I liked what I saw.,33,25-54,M
"As a history buff, I wanted to know my own history, but what came from this has been even more invaluable.  I grew up with no cousins.  I always knew my mother did not personally know her biological father and in the summer of 2013 I began my search for him.  I found that he passed in the late 1990s, but through my research on this site and good old fashioned calling people through the phone book, I found that I have an aunt and an uncle I did not know.  I have cousins!  When the Ancestry DNA came about, of course I purchased it.  I discovered some very interesting things about myself and my history.  I found more cousins!  I love knowing I have a real connection to this world. Downside--cost.  I feel that I can locate a lot of this information on my own if I had the time.  These ARE public documents we are discussing, so I feel that there should be more pricing options for different needs.",31,25-54,F
"I know I haven't shopped here in a while, but I guess I'll just take them out completely and unsubscribe to email.  My order had everything price reduced to beat out some other websites and so I placed it.  Received confirmation email with lowered total and then see the next day a higher total is taken out from them.  No email or heads up, so canceled my order.  From the total I think I'll just stick with my previous supplier from the last time I reviewed who also has a flat rate shipping of $5.95.",29,25-54,M
"I have been using Priceline for more than 10 years to get the best hotel deals on the Web. I have no complaints so far and will continue to use Priceline for the forseeable future. The only disadvantage that I have seen so far is the lack of options for selecting a hotel with certain features that may sometimes be important for me - such as free breakfast, free parking, close to the bus-stop, having a kitchen, etc. But in most cases, the selection works out wonderfully even without having to mention these options.",39,25-54,M
For the past 10 years I have been holding on to tens of thousands of dollars of credit card debt.  Reallybadcreditoffers.com has provided me with information that is helping me reduce this debt and is helping me get back on track to a debt-free lifestyle.,41,25-54,M

I bought a $25 League of Legends prepaid card! I went to redeem this card and got a error 4002: Card Is Deactive (The same error given if the card was stolen and was not activated at the register) I talked to a support representative and a refund was given. Overall this was a bad experience and I don't believe i'll do doing business with this website again.,58,55-64,M
"I can confidently say that Ancestry is THE resource for genealogical research. With as little as a few names and dates, an average person can easily start a family tree on Ancestry. They will soon find that Ancestry has made available, more documentation and information on their family than they likely imagined existed. Ancestry's massive databases provide a seemingly endless supply of historical documents from Census forms to Birth Certificates, to Marriage Licenses, and far beyond. Their user interface is certainly - in my opinion - easy enough for just about anyone to use. In addition to that, one can see that improvements to the overall customer experience are regularly made and implemented. New features are introduced, site navigation is streamlined, images and documents are easy to read; I especially appreciate how easily one can ""move around in"" the image viewer. Zoom in/out, ""hand-grab"" cursor, mouse-wheel based zoom, rotate, and ""next image"" are all features that contribute to the quality and ease-of-use of this site. If you have ever wanted to know where your family was from; if you have ever wanted to learn more of your family history, I would highly recommend trying Ancestry.com",37,25-54,M
I have been using Ancestry.com almost from the very beginning of starting my family tree online which was about 1996. I have used other websites but almost always come back to Ancestry.com to find my information.,73,65+,F

"I had run out of ideas on what to do for a bridemaids dresses. I had looked at all the local stores. Either I didn't like the dress or my girls didn't like the dress. So I turned my search to the internet. I found a great dress on outerinner.com. I was a little nervous or cautious about getting dresses online. I was running out of options and I found a dress that everyone liked. So the girls bought the ""Floor-length Chiffon Square Ruffles Bridesmaid Dresses"". We were all nervous waiting for the dresses to arrive. However, I really liked this company's return policy. That gave me peice of mind. Most places online give you no options to return the dresses if there are issues. The ordering was easy. The dresses arrived quickly. And we all loved the dresses! This was an overall great experiance. I would recommend this company to anyone. I almost wish I would have gotten my bridal dress here. Very pleased!",37,25-54,F
"Our mailbox was destoryed by some kids. It was an old mailbox so it didn't take much. We didn't want to replace it with just a standard ""Box Store"" mailbox. We wanted something different and that would last. We found it here. We got good customer service. No issues there. We loved the new mailbox. As much as you can ""love"" a mailbox. It was what we were looking for at a great price. The item showed up one day before the estimated delivery date.",37,25-54,F

I was glad to have come accross this company on the web. They have some great unique items that you don't see in every other store or site. I also called there Customer Service to ask a few questions. They were very helpful and knew what they were talking about. The items I bought were shipped quickly and I received the stuff as decribed. No issues no problems. I am going to buy several of this years Christmas presents here. This is a good company and I would do buisness with them again and recommend them to my friends and family.,36,25-54,F
"I bought a rim and tire package for my son for his birthday. Anthony was the rep that helped me put it all together. This was a smooth transaction with Exclusivetires.com.

The prices were very good for what my son wanted. Over all I was very happy with the transaction and my son loved his birthday gift.",36,25-54,F
"I have always heard that you could get money for your old mobile phones but always thought yeah but not much. I happened upon this company and liked that they would tell me what company is more likely to give me the most money back, the best deal and not be a scam. I used this company to get rid of the 6 mobiles I had laying around the place. I have even turned a few friends on to this site and they have had great luck with them also. I was impressed. I will be more quick to sell my old phones now so I can get the best return on them when I get a new phone",36,25-54,F

Everything went smooth and I am happy with the product. I would buy from this company again.,36,25-54,F
I was very pleased with the high quality of this product. I have been getting hair extentions for years and there always seems to be some kind of issue with them. Either they don't look real or the color or quality is off. Not with Hairlet. I was very surprised there were NO issues. I will be a repeat customer from now on and let everyone know about this place.,36,25-54,F

I have used Arena a few times before and I wanted to surprise my wife with a birthday treat whilst on holiday.  It's impossible to know what local florists are going to be like so using Arena seemed like the obvious thing.  We had a beautiful bouquet delivered on the right day and with flowers still in bud -- they still look amazing days afterwards. I saw the reviews here about Valentine's flowers.  Mine were ordered a few days after and all seems to be fine now.  I've not had a problem before so guess it's all solved now.,39,25-54,M

"I have purchased several keys over the years from CJS keys, and to be honest. There is no educated or logical reason to go anywhere else. The have their own ""AutoKey"" system which is an instantaneous screenshot of the key (in the event a game company wants to ask for a picture of the cd-key itself , you can download it and show them or keep for your own records) It is stored securely in a database and you can access it whenever you so choose. I highly recommend CJS keys for ALL of your CD key needs. Not only is the PRICE the best on the internet, its the people and employees behind the company that really make it shine. Also having the best CD Key distribution in the industry doesn't hurt either. :) Highly A++++ Recommended! All my friends in IT use this site as well!",28,25-54,M

I sent an email to the person responsible for insurance and they responded with a 1-800 number that informed me they couldn't help me since my confirmation number didn't work for their system.  I then called the rentalcars.com website 1-800 number only to be transferred to 3 different people.  The last person was located in the UK and had no idea how to help me since all the people of in the US have had the same problem.  Their answer was to cancel the whole reservation and re book. The problem with this is that the price has increased from when I first made the reservation.",35,25-54,F

"This is absolutely the best website for acquiring supplements and nootropics. It's the most expensive supplement site I've ever used, but it's well worth the price. The finest ingredients, the most comprehensive random assortment of cool foods and snacks, and one killer workout tech section. The addition of Onnit 180 was PERFECT timing and I'll try using that product for a hangover (For science of course.) I'm trying to convert the rest of my IT team to Alpha Brain and New Mood. I just want to thank Onnit for the fine quality and ease of buying supplements for any occasion.

"I am recent customer of onlineticketexpress and I can say only bad and very bad things about this company. I really don't believe that any of the positive reviews listed here are true. Here is the mail I have send to them after finalizing whole deal  (tickets for the first game Euro 2012 Poland-Greece) ""OK you want me to give my comments about deal through you company than here you have. First I didn’t received tickets I ordered .I ordered 2 tickets so called VIP Gold which of course were most expensive with information that they would be best avalaible seats on the side tribunes. I havent’t got those I received instead 2 tickets of 2 category nominal value of 1 ticket 560 zł approx 130 Euro (I paid 600 Euro). So I feel cheated by you with no word explanation. If you consider yourself fair, professional and service minded company I should get some kind of compensation. Secondly the way you handled whole deal was disaster. In the order confirmation you wrote that tickets should be delivered 3-5 days before the event . In fact I haven’t got any information earlier than just one day before. I tried to to get info by phone but this was impossible neither of your phone numbers answered. I should get my tickets delivered to my private address instead I got info that I must collect them myself at the airport on the specific time  actually very late just 3 hours before the  event. Luckily I live in Warsaw what if I didn’t’? I was at the airport earlier than you recommended namely 2.30 pm and it was another lucky case not only for me but also for other people who decided to buy tickets through you. At TNT nobody was aware of shipment under the number I got from you because it was not in the system. But there  was guy who tried to communicate with TNT personel who hardly spoke English. I help them and it turned out that he was private courier who brought tickets from you among them also mine.  I asked people from TNT to call all other people and inform them also about their tickets. I hope that they got them on time. Summarizing my experience from working with you was very bad even more as I explained in the beginning I feel cheated. I am waiting for you prompt reaction before I place my comments on all avalaible review websites. Robert Pelka",58,55-64,M

"I just enjoy shopping at yesstyle.com Besides the site being completely user friendly, which is great kudos for me, they have a customer service that is reliable, which means that if i ever have a problem I know i will receive assistance. Their clothes, shoes, bags, accessories, etc, are all just amazing, I've tried looking for similar clothes at stores around me with no avail. They just have what i'm looking for every-time i come to the site. While yes its true that some of their items are pricey, if you know how to look you'll find some very affordable items. Another thing i just love about this site is that measurements are included for the products, and the many pictures of the item in inquiry. Shipping is reasonable, and very good. I have purchased 5 times from them and have never had any problems. I probably mentioned by others pay attention to the measurements, I always double check because I want to be sure what I'm ordering fits me and will be comfortable. No lie, i was a bit cautious the first time i ordered from them, and also one of the items that I ordered wasn't available anymore, so they had to cancel, deducted it from my order, and since i originally had free express shipping nothing changed afterwards, its just as they say on their website. I am quite pleased by how they handle checkouts as well, its very secure and it makes me feel safe how my information is being handle. Another thing that always surprises me is how they neatly and professionally they package the items, it so secure. Kudos to them, I hope they can open more shops globally!! That would be amazing!",21,15-24,F
They are very eager to help you get out of debt and work with you to set up your account with them. They are also very focused on customer service.

Be patient and be informed! Ask questions so that you understand the terms of the agreement.,53,25-54,F
"Like many people I was somewhat reluctant to order RX glasses over the Internet and from out of the country.  But SelectSpecs was less than half of my local eye shop and one of the best online prices I found. After having my glasses for several months, the nose pad came apart.  I asked what they could do and they let me return the frames for repair. Much to my surprise, SelectSpecs not only replaced the nose pads, but offered to replace my lens which had gotten scratched up -- all covered by warranty.  I didn't expect that as the scratches could have been considered an ""act of God""! What an amazing company.  People like Alina, Debbie, Christina and others made it worth taking a risk and buying internationally over the Internet. Thank you very much. Alan Henney Takoma Park, Md.",47,25-54,M

"I apologize for my previous review (negative). It was not O2s fault at all, but mine. First I gave a wrong number of my mobile requesting to unlatch. They wrote to me that number doesn't exist. Then I realized it was wrong indeed. Then I gave them a number, but I again realized few weeks later after reading the 'chat' record, that it was wrong too. Then I supplied the correct mobile number. Then they asked for its IMEI number, which they said can be found by dialing *#06# and I did that with my new phone without realizing that I should have dialed the above numbers using the old phone which I needed unlatching. So again I provided a wrong number. Later on I realized my mistakes and provided the correct details. Within minutes everything was sorted. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed. But the customer care persons on their 'chat' were all extremely polite all the time. It was completely my fault right from the beginning. So readers please disregard my previous comment. I apologize unreservedly to O2, and to you readers.",68,65+,M

"We only use BookaTrack, despite others appearing cheaper it is a false economy both on safety and track time. Here is usually open pit lane, but because they keep numbers overall restricted, there is no feeling of a ""boy racer joy riding fest"". Here there is all of the adrenalin and fun to be had under the best circumstances possible. You might want to doze off in the safety briefing or not bother with an instructor but both are a pretty much sure route to getting the very best from the experience. If you feel you are happy with the service from another company, just try there guys out...you will not go back to anyone else's set up...see you on track. Barry & SueK",55,55-64,F

"I ordered from SupplementMarket.com, and received the supplements in a timely fashion. However, when the shipment came, I noticed that one of the products was not the same as the one I ordered. I called them, and somehow their ""answering message"" girl picked up, told me that the office people might be busy so the call got diverted to their answering service. I told her my problem, and she took down my name and number, to forward it to the ""office"" staff, and they would call me back. Waited a day, and no call back. The next day I called again, and surprise, the ""answering"" girl picked up, with the same line "" give me your contact info"" and we will get back to you. I explained to her it was my second time calling, and gave her the info again. 4 hours go by, its coming close to end of business day, and still no call back. I called them again a THIRD time, and surprise, surprise, the answering girl picks up with the same line. I got fed-up with trying to reach them, CC company will be notied for a swift dispute. They hire answering machine people just to take messages?? Would it be easier, and quicker if the answering machine operators took care of consumer problems?? I suspect that they have a very poorly run operation with one person answering phones, and the other shipping items. They communication and customer service is the lowest. I gave them not1, not 2 but 3 chances to make it right, but they will not listen. I am an active member of several fitness and bodybuilding boards, and I will make my reviews about this company known to their customer base.",30,25-54,M
"I only had a problem once (my connection was very weak) and I payed twice for an hostel that was only booked once. They quickly refunded me and there were no problems at all.

I placed my order and a day later I received a phone call from the company letting me know that they received my order and that I would be getting them soon, and that if I had any questions to call them back. To me that meant a lot because most companies do not do anything like that. I received my order rather quickly. I am very satisfied with the customer service, the shipping, and the product. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone.",32,25-54,F

"I thought I was ordering a pair of gloves.  Boo, on me for not reading the fine print.  When I looked back on the page where I made the order, it did state one spot that the order was for one glove.  Boo, on HalloweenCostumes.com for being misleading.  The ""one glove"" fine print should have more apparent.  Who orders only one glove?  Could you imagine ordering only one shoe?  Also, there is no where to indicate if someone wants a right or left glove.  This would have been a fair indicator/notice that I would only get one glove.  I decided to go to local costume store to avoid getting another right glove.  I take online ordering seriously because companies easily rip people off with fees, misleading descriptions, and restocking fees.  I tell everyone about how HalloweenCostumes.com is misleading.",31,25-54,M

"For two years I used a paid defragmenter someone had recommended. When it was time to renew my subscription for the 3rd year, I happened to be broke at the time and decided to look for a free product to replace the paid one. Auslogics Disk Defrag was suggested as one of the best on many websites so I got it. I can’t believe I paid for a defragmenter for 2 whole years when there was a FREE alternative that actually works better! ADD works fast and is very easy to use, and you really can’t beat the price since it’s free. Auslogics has a paid professional defragmenter too, but I find it that the free one works great for me and is perfectly sufficient.",23,15-24,F
"When I'm looking for a particular outfit, I go to sheinside.com first. I looked around on this site for many months before making an actual purchase. The clothes were so cute, I just had to cave in and order a few dresses from sheinside. I was very pleased with the items I've received, and since then sheinside.com has become one of my ""go-tos"" for online shopping. I recently ordered their black handprint tassel dress and I love it so much because it fits my body perfectly. It also shipped to my house very quickly. They sell nothing but quality clothing which is always a plus for me. The site is so easy to navigate through as well! I never have any difficulties finding what I want. What I love most about sheinside is the fact that they're so affordable. I see the clothing that sheinside sells on other websites for 3 times the price, and I always feel like I hit the jackpot when I buy the same styles for a more affordable price. Besides the affordable price, there is so much to choose from! I discover something new whenever I shop on sheinside. i would definitely recommend this website to anyone who seeks affordable, cute, and quality clothing.",23,15-24,F

"A friend of mine introduced me to Supplement Warehouse a year or so ago, ranting about their low prices and nearly endless options of free items with every order. I've never been one to wait, so ordering supplements was ordinarily out of the question for me, but I somehow found myself on the site and I haven't gotten my supplements from anywhere else since. Not only are the prices lower, the service is also great. I also like that I can check out reviews on most any supplement right there on the site. I still hate waiting, but Supplement Warehouse does a great job of keeping me from having to do that with their excellent shipping times. A couple of weeks ago I found myself in a supplement store at a mall with a buddy checking out prices, and I couldn't help but to laugh out loud at the ridiculous prices after seeing what I can pay at Supplement Warehouse. This place is hands down the best out there.",24,15-24,M

"I'm a single mother from Newyork and currently my son is doing research in South Africa. The cost of international calls is too high, because of which we barely spoke once in 10 days. Few months back one of my son's colleagues suggested Rebtel to make cheap international calls. My son explained to me the concept of Rebtel which is based on internet telephony and why the calls made using Rebtel are cheap. Both of us have local Rebtel numbers on which we make a call, which gets internationally connected and that's how we speak to each other, every third day. And it is super easy to use. I don't have to worry about the bill s I can make payment through my credit card. I would sincerely recommend their customer support for guiding me through the entire process. Since my son is always busy on field, I take help from Rebtel customer support. The support system is apt and easily understandable by someone like me who is not technology friendly. I have even suggested Rebtel to my sister living in downtown Chicago. I just have one suggestion, please post me newsletters or other offers since I don't use the internet often. Thank you Rebtel !!",29,25-54,F

While I was impressed by the discount on the sunglasses I was absolutely appalled by the length of unnecessary time for shipment.

If you're looking for fast delivery this is not the place, spend a few extra dollars and head over to Bluefly.

"So, I broke the screen of my brand new Galaxy S5. When I notified Square Trade, we found out Samsung doesn't even offer replacement screens yet. I freaked, I can't survive without my phone. The customer service representative calmed me down and told me to go out and find a replacement locally, get it repaired and forward the invoice to them for reimbursement. I found a local repair shop, paid the outrageous sum and immediately forwarded the invoice to Square Trade. When I checked my email less than an hour later, the money had already been deposited into my PayPal account. Unbelievable customer service and attention to detail. Oh yea, to compensate me for all the hassle, they even waived the $99 deductible. I'll never insure an electronic device with anyone else !!! SQUARE TRADE ROCKS !!!",39,25-54,M

He made sure our i's were dotted and t's crossed all with a sense of humor, at a time when we had none. Unless you have completed this process in the past, you have no idea. He had my husband and I on speaker phone instructing us like a well trained conductor. I can not say enough about his attention to detail, his patience, and ability to  bring a calm to the storm. Our confidence would not have been the same if we did not have such a wonderful case manager.

Since then, I've used them repeatedly and I could not be happier!!! I insure everything that I buy, adding in the ADH, because I'm very accident prone with all my technology, and Square Trade has accommodated my every single problem. I've researched other warranty companies, and there are no others that offer what Square Trade does. Use this company! Trust them!!! You'll be happy you did!!!",48,25-54,F

Since then i've had lack of communication! emails telling me to do something but not how to do it! i was then for some reason sent my old code! i dont understand how thats going to fix my problem....time will tell as the sims3.com site is down for maintenance at the minute. I was instructed to ""ENTER DATE NIGHT KEY IN THE SIMS 3 GAME LOADER / SIMS3.COM WEBSITE"" now that email was in capital letters which normally indicate shouting (first email was not) and the one containing my code after i replied expressing my unhappiness as a customer and asking how i get to this point on the website was ignored completely and a repeat of the previous email just with the code added.",21,15-24,F

Having worked with Xicom for more than 8 months I am more than satisfied with their services. The iPhone & android application development teams are highly innovative and talented. They were very patient as the requirements were huge and new requirements would crop out on a regular basis. The project managers were always eager to discuss the project and add their suggestions for the project. I recommend them to everyone for all the iphone application development requirements. One of the best company I have ever worked with in the last 10 years.,24,15-24,M
"It seems that every company in America claims to have great customer service these days. Most companies seem to think that if they keep you on hold for less than two minutes they have done a great job. I don't normally write reviews and the only reason I am writing this is because every time (and I mean EVERY TIME) I have contacted Inmotionhosting, they have answered my questions or solved my problems immediately. In addition every representative I have contacted seems to have a great attitude. Even when I know I am asking fairly rudimentary questions they have never made me feel like it is an inconvenience to give a complete answer.",60,55-64,M

"I was very disappointed in the product I received. It was NOT what I had ordered. I had ordered a ""decorative line border"" locket with Text BLOCK engraving on the back. What was sent to me was the ""Greek Key"" design with Text SCRIPT engraving. Also, it stated that the locket was 1in by 1.25in but the width alone was barely .75in! It is very disappointing that I spent $90 to receive the wrong product. There is no excuse for this, as the site clearly states which locket is which and the catalogID on my order detail matches the one on the site for the ""decorative line border.""  I suppose it was foolish of me to even give this company my business after I read the reviews online, but I figured I would give them a chance. And when I emailed them about all of this, I didn't even get a response with an apology, let alone one that tried to make amends. Honestly, how hard is it to pay attention to detail? I'm thoroughly frustrated and disappointed in this company. The product is still acceptable enough to give as a gift - but to pay close to $100 and have almost every detail neglected, and for it to be on the wrong item entirely, and to not even get an apology?  I have lost all faith in this company. I gave them a shot in spite of what I read online, but they only proved those critics correct. Now I am unfortunately just ANOTHER critic. But what do they care, they got their money... Pathetic",25,25-54,F
"I just recently purchased several items from yandy.com and was amazed at how fast the items shipped. But, to my dismay, one of the outfits I received was flawed. They fixed the problem right away by sending me a new one! I was thrilled with their customer service, their expeditious shipping, the wide variety of items on their site, and even just the website design period. It is very efficient. I'm fairly picky with customer service results so for me to be this pleased is very surprising. But they obviously care about their customers and appreciate return business, versus other companies who feel like they already got your money so they could care less. I feel like making a purchase through them is a safe bet, I'm not going to have to wonder about the quality of the products, and if there is a problem I feel assured that they care enough to make it right. This will be my go to site for all my ""night-time"" outfits!",25,25-54,F
"I bid through Priceline for my first time and was a bit nervous about what kind of place would be booked. I tried it anyway. To my amazement, I was able to bid and get a great 2.5 to 3 star hotel in the Mandarin area of Jacksonville. What a deal! For $33 per night, yes, $33 per night, I got a great Queen non-smoking room on the first floor. The hotel is a bit older but well maintained and updated with a doting, friendly staff. To my surprise it also came with a free paper and great full breakfast buffet that wasn't your typical ""junk"" breakfast - no this was full buffet with fresh eggs, bacon, potatoes, grits, waffles, toast, fresh fruits, yogurt, cereals, biscuits and gravy, fresh juice, milk, coffee - I was very pleased. I highly recommend Priceline as they certainly looked out for me, and I got a deal and a hotel beyond my best expectations",56,55-64,M

"Pharmacy2u owns privatemeds.  a good synergy. pharmacy2u advertises a free consultation with a private meds doctor.  but in my case I was charged £20.  I was seeking a prescription for asthma. No reason was given why I should be charged and as I had spent 30 minutes on the ridiculously repetitive online questionnaire, I paid it (assuming it would be credited against treatments ordered).  Poor choice, no such luck. The treatment was prescribed.  No problem there. On pharmacy2u the meds cost £40.  Delivery costs £6 (to France).  A little more expensive than you could get on the high street, but not bad. On privatemeds (remember, the same corporate group as pharmacy2u), the charge is £50 plus £8 for postage. One might think that this is just privatemeds making an extra profit over the consultation fee that they ought not to have taken (remember, it's advertised as being free).  But no.  They make it very clear that the meds are being charged for, dispensed and dispatched ONLY by pharmacy2u. Which makes sense as privatemeds is offering the doctor-service. So it is pharmacy2u that is charging 39% more for the same medicine and delivery when the prescription is delivered by THEIR OWN doctors, than an external prescription.  Ignoring completely the £20 charge for a consultation. From follow up correspondence pharmacy2u repeatedly (four times) provided incomplete, misleading and (seemingly) deliberate obfuscatory answers to my questions. Two things that were clear however were: 1. the consultation fee is _sometimes_ free.  (no information on the stie about the circumstances - they say it's free.  full stop). 2. pharmacy2u say that the prices are set by privatemeds.  privatemeds say that the sale is made by pharmacy2u.  remember these are not massive companies, they are colocated in the same building and one is wholly owned by the other.  they use the same customer service team and somewhat worryingly they do not appear to segment their databases (this is an assumption as pharmacy2u tell me they refunded to me a payment made to privatemeds). I believe this service to have the possibility of being genuinely useful to busy professionals unable to get to their GP (or any other person unable for whatever reason to travel).  However I strongly feel that: 1. there should be complete transparency on the sites of pharmacy2u and privatemeds about their relationship. Transparency from the top (inter-locking directorships, ownership) to the bottom (profit sharing, customer services sharing etc, colocation etc) 2. there should be transparent pricing between the two sites (i.e. there is no reason for any price discrepancy to exist - the medicines are being ultimately sold by the same company). 3. the privatemeds site should not restrict to whom their electronic prescriptions are issued.  It is an unreasonable fetter on consumer choice to be constrained to a single dispensary and at prices that are (currently) set by privatemeds (the doctors).  In this circumstance there is a clear and unacceptable conflict of interest inside privatemeds to prescribe brands and/or medicines that have higher profit margins. I rate this as a set of sufficiently serious circumstances to report the organisations to the OFT.",42,25-54,M

"Babbel is very easy to use, very interactive,  and very quick to teach you a language. I thought learning German was going to be a long, strenuous task that I would have to force myself to do, but instead it's actually fun and I get on Babbel often. It feels like playing games. The course is very encouraging and it's easy to go back on a lesson to refresh your memory or try to understand something you missed. I was very unsure about buying Babbel but I took a shot at it and it was actually very cheap. And to be honest, they should be jacking money from our pockets like Rosettastone does. I am referring all of my friends to Babbel. Please, if you are wanting to learn a new language efficiently and easily,  don't waist your money on Rosettastone.  Get Babbel.

"Bought a Russian key of Rage from them, and it's not working because they only sent me the Sewers DLC key and not the actual GAME key. They issued a statement in Facebook that their supplier mixed up the keys. Also they advertise that they send actual photo scans of the boxes, which is not true, because I haven't received it, only an email with the key. Without the photo scan, I don't have any proof that the key is legit or not. They are still selling the game on their website without warning potential customers that there aren't keys available for the game. Until my Issue with Rage is fixed, I leave a poor rating.",32,25-54,M
"I was very unhappy and posted the very bad review below.  But rentalcars.com called me up on the phone (yes, they really did) after I sent them a letter of complaint similar to my review.  They offered to pay all the extra monies I had paid to Avis, admitting that they had been in error - and within two days they had paid it.  Good for you RentalCars.com.  Everyone can make a mistake but owning up to it is the sign of good customer service. My rental email correspondence with RentalCars.com assured me that we had no need to pay for excess insurance.  They explicitly wrote: ""you have Avis exclusive, this includes Zero excess, that's why is not possible to add our product Damage Excess Refund"".  But when I  got to the Avis rental counter, it turns out that we had not paid for any insurance at all. Rentalcars.com simply lied in their email correspondence. This little lie of theirs meant that I now had to pay an additional 250 euros over and above thel 300 euros I had already paid for the week car rental. This made this the absolutely most expensive rental in the country! They stopped corresponding with me once they realized they had made a mistake. I intend to sue them and would like advice as to how to do this. Any suggestions welcome.",63,55-64,F

"I decided to start getting fit again after a long lay off about 18 months ago and needed help with my recovery after training. I had entered the Cardiff Half Marathon and trained hard for it. I knew nothing about sports supplements at the time and a friend recommended JBC Nutrition. I nervously popped in to their old store in Newport and was greeted with a smile and made to feel like an old friend. Got some great advice and went away with plenty to think about, there was no pressure to buy, just good advice. Next time I was in the area I popped into their new place, again I was greeted as if I'd known them for years, Gareth remembered me from my last visit and after another little chat I went away with a 4kg tub of strawberry Ultimate whey, oh my word, that stuff tastes great. Went through a tub in no time and went back and bought 5 tubs, each one a different flavour. My only regret is they are lasting so long there is no need for me to pop in for a chat anymore. All in all, you're always made to feel welcome, never any sales pressure, always good advice and always good value. Cheers guys.",35,25-54,M

I don't think I'd ever visit Mui Ne again, but if I did I would absolutely use this service. The only small issue was that our driver didn't speak English and we had no way of communicating with him for the 5 hours in the car, which was a little awkward. We were able to ask a few questions by going through the bellman at our hotel when we were first picked up, but I wonder how it would've worked if this driver had picked us up at the airport and there was no one to translate for us.

"To anybody thinking of using the services of this company.... PLEASE DON'T!  I placed an order online on 27 July, paying in advance via SagePay.  An email confirmation was received immediately and that was the first and only contact I have managed to achieve with this company.  The telephone number supplied in the confirmation rings incessantly, with no scope for leaving a message.  Emails receive no response and although SagePay inform me that they contacted the company, I am not aware that they received any answer, either.  The address supplied in Herne Bay, Kent is a private house, which I have seen for myself as I live not far away.  I did not call in at the address as I was waiting for the ""reasonable time"" (30 days) to elapse before cancelling the order.  A recorded delivery letter to the address, informing the company of my intention to cancel the order under the Sale of Goods Act and the Distance Selling Regulations, has received no response, but has not been returned by the Post Office, so was presumably signed for. To add to the mystery, the company has not actually taken the payment via SagePay and will not now be able to do so.  I have now cancelled the order, am obviously without the goods ordered and have paid for a Recorded Delivery letter with no means of recouping the cost.  I shall now try to persuade SagePay to kick this company into touch as one of their merchants and am enlisting my local Citizens' Advice Bureau's help.  They intend to ask Kent County Council's Trading Standards Department to investigate britishsupermarketworldwide.com to ascertain whether the company is trading according to the relevant regulations. In the meantime, please avoid this company like the plague! PS to Trustpilot: what is the point of insisting on a minimum number of stars in a case like this?  One star out of five is a score of 20%: quite ludicrous!",66,65+,F

In addition to this I was able to find my favourite perfume, Jil Sander No 4, which is not on sale in the majority of UK retail outlets which is a terrific bonus!!",63,55-64,F

LOVE IT!",32,25-54,F
"Supplement Warehouse has the best prices to buy supplements. The prices are already low and then they offer a 5% price match if you can find a lower price anywhere else online. They charge a reasonable price for shipping based on shipping weight. They also have a plethora of free items including a shaker cup and Muscle & Fitness subscription. I have ordered from them several times and have received excellent customer service. The only (minor) compliant I ever have with them is that sometimes they are not offering or are out of stock in an item I am seeking to purchase. For instance this time I was trying to purchase Optimum Nutrition Glutamine Powder but they were not carrying it at all. However, overall the experience is a 5/5.",29,25-54,M

"I don't normally rate things because I always assume that they get lost in the mix of everything. The one thing I feel that is very important and now a requirement of any computer that's connected to the internet is protection from whatever lurks beyond the wall.  Yeah, that was a Game of Thrones reference. Anywho. I was never a fan of 'buying' Antivirus software and I would always go the cheap route by using whatever free protection I could find on the internet. Then one day I got infected with something pretty nasty and my trusty ol' free software did not cut it at all. I started to research online to find the right software. Bitdefender was always listed as number 1. The one feature that I liked that they marketed themselves on was that their software wasn't overpowering to your system. It ran in the background and used as little memory as possible. To make this gigantic story a whole heck of a lot shorter, for the last 7 years I have been using Bitdefender and I'm always a happy customer. I buy their new Total Security key every year and it's nothing but grand. Compared to the others that are out there, they can't even scale up against Bitdefender. You can set it to autopilot and it does all the work for you. I apologize because I have such bad ADHD I have a hard time articulating my thoughts and look a bird! I'll be a lifelong Bitdefender customer as long as I have a computer. Thanks for putting out great software guys and gals.",31,25-54,M

"Just installed a rebuilt 3RZFE engine in a 99 Toyota Tacoma for my son. For those of you that need 1 they are hard to find and $1600.00 plus core charge. Once complete it would not run properly, We started trouble shooting to find that 2 of the 4 injectors were badly corroded. So I ordered replacements from BuyAutoParts.com. After installing the engine ran slightly better but still on not all 4 cylinders. While starting a noid test to see if the injectors are getting the proper fire, on the second injector the engine made a loud knocking sound that concerned the mechanic I was working with. We pulled the plugs out to see that #3 plug was drenched in fuel and had not been firing. The new injector had filled the cylinder with fuel causing hydrolock (bent cylinder rod). After contacting BuyAutoparts.com about the defective part they wanted to speak to the mechanic and they would get back to me shortly. My mechanic called them then called me back, after 4 hours waiting for Buyauto to call me then I finally called them back. The customer service person was to send a replacement injector at no charge but refuses to give me any assistance in repairing the damaged caused by the faulty part. She even stated that the part is probably not bad but I had other issued causing the injector to dump fuel and the same problem would happen with the replacement. I took the injectors and had them tested to find that 3 were operating properly spraying 10cc's of fuel yet the 4th was spraying 80cc's which filled the cylinder with fuel and caused this problem. I then contacted BuyAutoParts.com again, I sent them paperwork indicating the test results along with a video of the test, I again asked about liability and how they are going to assist me in the additional repairs. They stated that their warranty does not  cover labor replacing a defective part yet I kept stating I was not looking for labor on the part, I needed parts and labor to repair other issued caused by the part. They sent me a copy of the warranty and the last line is ""WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE AUTO PART SOLD"". Here it is, I'm screwed! I with I could expressly disclaim liability in my business and get away with it. Them I realized that this company is a Google Trusted Store so I contacted Google for assistance with my issued. Google was able to get me a full refund of the original cost of my order but they were not able to get BuyAutoParts.com to take responsibility for the problems they caused me. Now thanks to this faulty part I have to spend another $300.00 in additional parts along with the labor cost to repair a perfectly good engine that has never ran before!",47,25-54,M

"Frontpoint has completely changed my life.  Due to a divorce I am finding myself living alone for the first time ever.  Safety was a huge concern, but so was the security of my two german shepherds, who are my life.  I was surprised at how easy it was to call and receive my new alarm system.  In addition to the alarm, I was able to order a camera and light switch.  My life is go, go, go with very weird hours.  I am able to remotely turn my alarm on and off so my parents can drop by and let the dogs out.  I can also turn a light on at night for when I return late.  But the BEST feature of all is the camera.  Not having anyone to let my dogs out and wondering if they were disturbing the neighbors, I purchased the Frontpoint camera, and installed it above the crates my dogs sleep in during the day.  I can now check on them any time I want, offering me peace of mind and allowing me to focus on work.",33,25-54,F

This is so important as a budget backpacker and can't stand when I have to search through pages of results on other websites to find what I want. The fact that hostel bookers don't have a booking fee is awesome. Those few dollars you would have paid in booking fees really add up after a while.

"I have been renting a car on a weekly basis for 18 months. I have used a number of rental car agencies with varying results and Enterprise Rental Cars at LAX is by far my favorite.  Although I have waited in some VERY long lines at the counter (despite having their preferred customer card) the service is always friendly, they seem to remember me from week to week, the cars are usually new (with less than 30,000 miles), and the return is always speedy.  However, I would like to see ALL rental car agencies support the U.S. economy by providing an ALL AMERICAN made car fleet. As far as Rentalcars.com goes...the site is very easy to use.  However, when researching my reservations, it can be confusing that the ""itinerary number"" and the ""confirmation number"" are two different numbers.  I have also had some difficulty inputting my AARP discount. Recently the site format was changed so that I cannot change a reservation without first cancelling an existing one.  So, it makes shopping for a better rate more difficult.

"This was my first time using Hostelbookers and it was great! I was looking for a place in Kolkata, India and I tried making a reservation through a hostel's website. When my reservation wasn't confirmed, I turned to Hostelbookers. Not only did they provide great information and confirm my reservation, but the price was even a bit cheaper! The fact that I didn't have to pay a booking fee was great. I'd surely use them again. Only downside is the limited selection and number of reviews people have left.",26,25-54,M

"I own a Vista laptop… Yah I know it’s a terrible OS and all that. It was a handmedown and it wasn’t exactly fast when I got it… but it got a lot worse over time. A friend recommended Auslogics Defrag. I downloaded and used it which made things a bit better but not a lot. Then I saw the ad for Boostspeed and figured it was worth a shot. The thing is a miracle worker! My laptop had never run so smooth and fast since the day I got it as it did after I used Auslogics. I didn’t care if it’d get trashed by this software as I was about ready to throw it out the window myself, so I let the program loose on it. Enabled every feature, didn’t make any backups and okayed everything the program suggested fixing. I now have a normal running laptop and Vista is not a problem. I even like Vista now that I see it can be pretty fast. Auslogics is my hero!",34,25-54,F

You know the saying, if it's too good to be true... then it probably is! Wrong in this case! Ordered the key and even with the verification SMS malark as it was my first order, the whole process was under 5 minutes! I've registered the key successfully so 5 stars from me!

"This is the worst merchandise/purchase I ever made. I ordered a pair of Ray Ban prescription sunglasses about three weeks ago from smartbuyglasses.com, it took them that long to complete my order. So guess what? The 14 day return policy that they have is NO good because they take over 14 days to send the order. When I finally got my order the shades were in separate plastic bags. So I'm thinking there has to be an instruction manual on how to attach my shades to my prescription glasses, but there wasn't. So I sent them an email asking for instructions and this is there original email response: ""Dear KJ, Thank you for your email to SmartBuyGlasses, my name is <Name Removed> and I am pleased to be of assistance today. We are happy to hear you've received your item. I regret to inform you we do not have the instructions for this. If you can not do it yourself, please ask your local optician to assist you, normally it is free of charge. Please do not hesitate to contact us in the future with any questions, comments or concerns that you may have. Thank you again for your support of SmartBuyGlasses! Best Regards,<Name removed> Customer Support Team, SmartBuyGlasses"". Are you serious? What the hell am I suppose to do with unattached shades? Glue them on or use duck tape!! It doesn't end there. So when I ask for a full refund of $395 they refer me to there refund policy which says I can't exchange prescription glasses, but if they weren't prescription I had 7 days to ship the item back to Hong Kong, at my expense, and exchange them for something else if they arrived in good condition. It took them seven days for the item to reach me from China, so if you spend one day waiting for an email response from some <Name Removed> then you've already lost. Buying prescription sunglasses from SmartbuyGlasses is not only stupid but insane. I should've invested my money here in the United States at my local optometrist. As a consumer and U.S. veteran I am insulted at the unethical practices of Chinese businesses on hard working Americans. I will be creating a website soon that show the pics of of my purchase, email conversations, and my experience with SmartBuyGlasses. Stay tuned.",38,25-54,M

"Ok I placed an order a few days ago and tried to price match one of my products to another site and at the beginning of my order they gave me the 5% less as advertised. But then I got an email saying that the site that I found with the lower price wasn’t eligible because of the way they do their shipping. Then the next day I got an email saying my order was canceled due to a credit card issue. The credit card thing was probably my fault (fat fingers). However, I just resubmitted my order and did a side by side comparison to bodybuilding.com and even with a 10% coupon my price was 25$ less with SW.",29,25-54,M

"I stayed at the Makronissos Holiday Village just outside ayia napa. It was a brilliant hotel, the bungalow we had was spacious and kept very clean at all times. The staff were all fantastic - friendly, helpful and fun. The only let down was the food. We stayed all inclusive and ate at the restaurant for most meals. I read some great reviews beforehand that said the food was really good but when we got there we heard the hotel was under new management so potentially this is why the food was below the standard we expected. It was still decent and for the most part edible but it definitely could have been better. It was all very samey and the hot food was never more than lukewarm. The included drinks were great, really good variety. I would definitely go back to the makronissos, perhaps not all inclusive although it would be shame not to have the unlimited drinks!!!",24,15-24,F
"Easy to use website, reasonable prices. Had a bit of an issue with collection so used the live chat tool. First girl I spoke to was useless and rude and didn't do what she said she'd do.

"I bought two stainless steel food/water bowls from Basis Pet and I'm very happy with the quality. You can't really tell from the photos but the bowls are heavy grade and thicker on the bottom so they sit well and are solid.

There are lots of pictures for each item, so my items always look like what I expected when they arrive. I find so many more things that I like on this site than at the mall. They have sales often (big anniversary sale in the summer) and if you sign up to become a member, they send you good coupons sometimes. Plenty of stylish clothes in the $10-$25 range are available! Oh, and there's free shipping to the US when you spend $150+. Definitely one of the main places I shop.",19,15-24,F

I ordered a deluxe 79$ dollar flower arrangement to be delivered to my wife for Valentines Day. When I got home to see the flowers they were half dead and not even close to the same arrangement I ordered. Never the less I was embarrassed and humiliated.

"Great concept, horrible company. What you need to know: the quotes are not ""free"" in as much as you have to pay to act on them. Shiply calls it a ""deposit"" but it's actually a non-returnable fee for getting the contact details of the shipping company. If for whatever reason the shipping company is unable to fulfil, shiply keep your money, no ifs no buts. In my case I never heard from the shipping company, they didn't contact me to complete and they never replied to emails, and shiply kept my money and were dismissive in the process. I think that breaches UK consumer protection laws and have reported them to trading standards. I have seen lots of other people with similar complaints who have had to try and recover their money from their credit card or paypal. I think when the service works it's great, but if something goes wrong you are screwed.",46,25-54,M

"I bought tablet PIPO M6 PRO 32GB. Delivery was ok, although the vat tax in Netherlands was not counted in so I had to pay that extra (70 EUR) when it went through customs in Netherlands. I ordered a case but it had opening for camera on the wrong side. I cannot verify specification of the Tablet but it barely seems to have the advertised properties. The display quality is good but the system is sluggish (slower than my smartphone), waiting for opening apps too often for too long unless they are already in memory. Still trying to figure out batery life but so far it isn't very good. Orientation of Camera in Skype is mixed - not rotating properly, always upside down unless rotation is turned on and in horizontal position. Camera quality is poor. Once the device got stuck while opening the Google Play market.Completely unresponsive and no combination of any keys helped. I had to wait until batery died out and then turned it on. I requested a return or compensation for bad quality device but so far no response. I do not recommend buying from them. Rather pay a bit extra somewhere else. I think it is chinese company (although in USA) and their customer service is very poor once the stuff is sold.",28,25-54,M

"I had not heard of Grooves Inc before but entered a Quiz on Facebook expecting to just go on a mailing list, but was surprised to receive an e-mail saying I had won 100 Euros to spend online at Grooves Inc. I was a little skeptical but visited the site, which has a very good selection of CDs, DVDs and other items, and made my selection. I used the code in the e-mail to pay and free delivery was promised worldwide so my living in Rio de Janeiro was a good test. All duly arrived in good time (for Rio where any overseas post usually takes 2 weeks or more) and I am very happy. The prices are good too so I got a lot for my €100 and will certainly consider Grooves Inc when buying CDs etc in the future.",62,55-64,M

"The company I work for needed to get some things through PayPal and I attached their bank account and credit card to my account so they could take care of some things. The VERY NEXT DAY my account was limited. They immediately associated my account with a PayPal account I had 2 years ago with a negative balance. Because of this, the business is now UNABLE to have their own PayPal account because their bank and card is attached to mine. After speaking with Liz who's PayPal Badge Number is 182899 she told me in a recorded conversation that there is NO-ONE at PayPal who would be willing to take action and remove the business information so they can have their own account. EVEN THOUGH their information was on my personal account. They would not let them take their own bank account and credit card off my account. In Short, PayPal limited an account after it had been opened for over a year immediately after this business had their information attached to the account. They immediately found a reason to go after a person by taking advantage of a company. They could have limited this account any time within a 12 month period but they suddenly choose to limit it today? Needless to say, I paid my balance and removed the limitation but only because the company needed to have their bank and card back so they could create their own PayPal account. PayPal uses other people's money to their advantage, they can limit accounts on the fly, and they do what they want with their users. PayPal is an UNSAFE system for the Business Owner to utilize in the terms of they have Full Control, you do not* Unfortunately their are not that many alternatives to PayPal on the market today which PayPal uses to their advantage. They make interest on their account balances and they make a lot of money. It's like they're greedy enough to make others suffer. Bravo right, I say this is a poor business practice and the company needs to think about the way they do business with their users. I also think eBay needs to think about using another alternative to PayPal. It's up to you what you want to use, but frankly I'd rather work with a company that works with me like Payza, Escrow.com, and Moneybookers or Skrill. The fact that I take the time to review this experience should be enough for you to not use their selfish and greedy service. I was also told by Liz that I could get a copy of the call since ""they record all their calls"". Once I got to the right department, they said I needed to call their Legal number at 408-967-9915 and I'd have to subpoena to get the call. My guess is they will destroy the evidence now and say no such call happened. God the whole company upsets me and what's hard is you can't get mad at their reps, they are just doing their job which the beast has trained them to do. I hope this helped some of you make the right decision.",26,25-54,M

"I love YesStyle's ""Ready to Ship"" Section, it's so convenient if you're looking for a new outfit on the rush! I've been looking for a good, lightweight jacket for a birthday party outfit and found one- on sale for about $10! Super convenient sales. My order that I recently placed was 70% off due to the huge anniversary sale YesStyle had (July 2012). Now that's discount style! This is my 3rd time ordering from here, and I love the wide range of styles that are available. I would totally recommend YesStyle to anyone looking for a new wardrobe change or for even just fashion inspiration! 5 stars all around!",19,15-24,M
"At £20 a ticket online, it was great value for money. The staff are easy to find and friendly. The bus maps and routes are very clear and they take you to all the great places in London. The guides are informative, lively and do their best to help the passengers. The only downside being London traffic. It took the best part of 2 hours to get from London Victoria to the tower of London.",22,15-24,M
"My son and I had accidentally ordered a game twice, and I was worried that since they had a no refund policy I would end up paying for both. This turned out to be false when I got on live-chat with a rep. Since I had not claimed either key, they quickly solved the issue and cancelled one of my orders! We then quickly received the key and my son was downloading in no time!",17,15-24,M
"Had a little trouble with Supplementwarehouse in the past, but after going away from them for awhile, I read that many of the problems I once had have been resolved. Now I have been ordering from them for about 2 yrs not a problem. Won't order from anywhere else again.",22,15-24,M
"I have ordered from other companies before, but they are nothing in comparison to this. I mean, really, BEAT THE COMPETITOR'S PRICE? You will never see any supplement company allow that, and will force their price on you. That, and you can get free stuff just for ordering. What isn't there to love? The shipping is fast and easy. The website is secure. This place is awesome. This place has one more customer for life!!!",19,15-24,M
I have bought several products from Homehealth uk and I am very pleased. They ship fast and the items are well packed. All my orders have been perfect.,36,25-54,F
I recently purchased a webcam and was initially drawn to buy.com from a google search. They had a wide selection of web cameras at unbeatable prices. I had a very positive experience and received my product within a few days. Overall wonderful experience and I have since purchased many items from buy.com. Thank you!,32,25-54,M
I ordered a pair of extremely hard to find moccasins from Minnetonka at 2am and received confirmation that my shoes had shipped within a few hours. I received my shoes less than 48 hours from my purchasing date and must say the quality is incredible. I am so happy with my shoes and want to thank everyone at The Shoe Mart for updating me every step of the way. You have made a lifelong client! THANK YOU!,32,25-54,M
Site is very user friendly and I loved the different and up to date fashion options. Bought a pair of shoes at an incredible price!,32,25-54,M

"I have used Barringtons for a few years now. and have never had an issue, the site is very clear about stock levels and when items have had to be ordered in, you are kept updated about the progress. I have had to send items back in the past (a stick snapped on with use and shoes were the wrong size) both times I was either refunded without any problems or a replacement stick was dispatched straight away. The collect + service for free returns is also very useful. Overall I highly recommend the site and prices are competitive.",22,15-24,M
"Could not find a memory card locally.  People told me to buy a new camera.    I went on line, ordered, and got just what I needed at a fair price with fast shipping.  Saved me the price of a new (and probably not as good)  camera.",69,65+,M
"I was naturally concerned to use this company for fear it was a scam, but after being reassured by previous users, I gave it a shot. They use a reputable third-party card payment system, and the fraud prevention system is easy and quick - you give them a landline or mobile number, and they call or text it with a code. You enter the code in the website, and you get your game key... simple! Key was delivered instantly, and recognised as authentic on the GW2 website. Away I went to play the best MMO I've played in years. It has always frustrated me that, in this electronic age, I have to wait for a company to post a key to me on a card instead of simply telling me the key. Even when you can get a key electronically, the official websites like Blizzard and NCSoft charge a premium over normal retailers; shouldn't it be cheaper!?!",35,25-54,M
Qick and effective service unlike Code Unlock Now. I am still waiting for a refund as promised.,68,65+,M
"Contacted them within 24 hours by email and text as dresser top damaged. I clearly stated that the wood was split across the top. A garbled voicemail left on the landline, email to raise a complaint on the web site - as my email was not clear enough! No reply to my further two emails. No contact by mobile, despite they have my mobile number. Pathetic. It is clear that they do not read your emails, and you are expected to chase them.",67,65+,M
"YesStyle is AWESOME! It has great style and discounts happen so often! I can always find something I like. If I'm stuck my answer is always on Ask Nikki! I really like how there's no minimum purchase (many other sites require a large minimum purchase T___T). Sometimes my items are not ready-in-stock and are delayed, but even so YesStyle is able to  ship out my items in a very reasonable time. I am so happy my items can come and I don't have to wait too long. Any order over 150$ has free shipping AND a tracking code!!! Most other places I shop at don't give me a tracking number (to Canada) or they ship by weight (and it's expensive). With all these benefits, I can shop whenever I want, the stuff will arrive quickly and I'm sure it's safe <3",20,15-24,F
Order Number: 8783 The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I called several times and no one returned my phone calls. But everything came shipped properly and the FMIC is awesome.,20,15-24,F

I have been using Priceline for years and have yet to be disappointed.  This is how I book my hotels 99% of the time.

I feel as if I have gotten MORE than my money's worth using Priceline over the years.,90,65+,F

"Xicom was an obvious choice to outsource my iPhone app development project. I had heard a lot about their work commitment, client committal and value-driven approach, and they proved it all true! They completed my app within a given time frame, while ensuring that all quality standards are met. The final app was highly functional, fast loading, and adhered to all pre-requisites mentioned by me. What a professional work attitude! I will definitely hire them for my future development endeavors!",16,15-24,F
"I've bought a couple of games from CJS CD keys now, and for the most part, it has been a painless procedure of me ordering, paying and redeeming the key with the autokey system. The only fault is that the 2-12 hour delivery period they claim is false in some cases, and contacting support to get an estimate on delivery is a hassle due to the support ticket system failing, for me at least. So far I still feel CJS rates a 4/5, even with a couple of delayed deliveries.",29,25-54,M
"Item was ordered using Next Day delivery by 1.00pm. Was despatched next day as ordered late, and arrived early next morning. Great quick service.

"I have been shopping with Shopto.net for over a year now and they have become my first choice for online shopping in the gaming market. Once I always went to GAME without looking elsewhere but when they started putting their prices up at ridiculous ammounts and there delivery service was gettig appalling I started looking for at other options, I was pointed to Shopto by a friend and was amazed at the differece in prices of the games, were talking £35.85 on Shopto for a game where GAME.co.uk was charging £42.99 for the exact same thing. Whats more Shopto got it to me the very next day with their free postage method, so far that has been unmatched. I now always recieve pre-orders early my most recent being Darksiders 2 which I got 3 days before launch and almost all the time Shopto are cheaper than everywhere else. The last game I bought from GAME I pre-ordered and didn't recieve it until a week after launch, that is just unacceptable. I would reccommend Shopto to anyone lookinbg for a reliable company which most certainly offers the best prices around pretty much all the time.",25,25-54,M
Good to have so many options when looking for a place to go. Last Minute helps me out of a bind many times and well worth you to check out. great prices and good quality information.,40,25-54,M

"The item was a good price and delivered quickly. However part of the item was damaged, to be fair I got a 10% refund very promptly once I emailed them, however maybe they could rethink their packaging. Sizing is slightly incorrect too, I ordered a small which it says on the website is a UK 8-10, however it is slightly too baggy to be an 8-10.",26,25-54,F

"It's a gamble, sometimes you'll be OK, sometimes not. When I paid for Sniper Elite I expected to be able to play it on the day of release, I thought wrong despite their assurance. A game being out of stock due to unexpected high demand is somewhat out of their control and is understandable. However, to be continually lied to and being told ""tomorrow"", ""full re-stock Monday"" and then not receiving your CD key is beyond frustrating. They lie to you so you don't get a refund and go elsewhere, had I have known how long it would of taken, I would of just got it somewhere else. Edit to their reply: OK then, so you get them ""fully restocked"" - and then what, i'm supposed to guess my CD key??",24,15-24,M

With that saving we will make another trip isn't  that great? For a first experience we couldn't ask for better Now I just have to say this for those who put bad reviews for the wrong reasons wich is most of the time (but not always...) because THEY didn't do the right thing to begin with... I don't work for book it, I'm a teacher but I hate seeing people bashing and not assuming!!! when we take the time to read everything and select the right choices there is NO problem... its not the company's fault when WE make mistakes...so they do what they can to help us IF they can but if not well deal with it... and at least make the right comment if they were still kind and they did the best they can!

"That's what I think, aside from the CS that maybe is defficient and slow, the service itself does it right, if you have a problem, mostly is client-side (your PC fault or Your fault...) I always recommend Steam, also, I always recommend to buy games with discount or wait until christmas or discount seasons to see if your wished game is at least 20% off, so it's a real deal... I just buy the games without discount when Im REALLY dieing for playing the game or there's too much time until discount season so well, I go ahead equally... So much people complain about DRM Titles, yes, they have DRM Titles, OK... You're advertised and you KNOW which ones are DRM, if you're a fool that installs the game in every computer you have then change your computer constantly well, it seems that you got enough money to buy the game again or you could just go ahead with the physical version that will not make you such a headaches... That's out of the hands of Steam. I give Steam a 8.5/10 because of the Support for the people that don't know how to solve basic problems on the PC (Below the common gamers knowledge or just casuals)... But for my Folks, the ones that knows what to do when we're in some trouble, you can go ahead without worrying about Steam CS and solve it yourself, giving steam a 9 or 9.5/ 10... (Because of the very closed and strict Game Genres divisions) (That's the only bad thing of it, so when I want a game I just go to the search bar type and enter and that's all) Steam Rocks.

"We were so excited about seeing the apartment after having a look at all the fab pictures online, and no way did it disappoint when we arrived! The amazing kitchen with enormous table ensuring that everyone could eat together and all mod cons to make sure we didnt waste time washing up when we should have been partying! All the bedrooms had their own lovely little quirk with beautiful original features and lovely comfortable beds. The bathrooms all had their own little quirk, with everyone loving the deep bath in one, and the 'Penthouse suite' shower (as we called it!) - and of course the amazing shower and sauna under the kitchen! The lounge again was a great space for entertaining with all the facilities needed and ensured that everyone relaxed straight away as it felt so much like home. The Saturday of the hen weekend we spent doing a treasure hunt around Brighton town centre, as is typical of our British weather, it rained pretty much all day, and we were all so pleased that the apartment was just a stones throw from the beach and the lanes, so we could make a quick dash back. We had some wristbands and vouchers waiting for us when we arrived on the Friday to use on the Saturday night, and although we didnt use them all we did get to go to Oxygen bar, which was one road away from Apartment and just across the road from Oceana, where we had free entry. We all had a fab night, and was so nice to just kick off the high heels when we got in and just sit in our pyjamas in the living room altogether looking back at pictures from the weekend on the massive TV. The rest of the weekend we enjoyed the better weather by going to the pier and having a bit of a shop and then chilling out back at the apartment and enjoying the view from the top floor terrace. We got so much positive feedback from everyone that came to the hen weekend to find out about staying in the apartment and others in future and was very sad to shut the door on the Monday morning!",27,25-54,F

One button updating per issue with the option to back-up prior to installing new drivers.  One poster commented on starting from the bottom and working up; this I recommend.  My chipset drivers were from 2006-2009, I installed the very bottom recommendation and it knocked out 18 issues in one download.

EVEN THOUGH I was careful to have my work address listed at my credit card, and at PayPal, they still triggered a card fraud alert at my credit card (American Express) and would not send me the product EVEN AFTER I phoned them to ask if all was OK and they said ""Yes, all is OK. It will ship today."" Then later that day I got an email saying I needed to do some additional verification steps. As a result, I did not get my product until after my work package cage opened up after New Years.",47,25-54,M

"I found some of the lowest prices on ""Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey"" on this website. I was only able to find ONE lower price and after typing that address into the ""Price match"" bar the price was lowered even more! The site was easy to navigate and had so many products it was hard to choose from. On top of the amount of products, it was hard not to buy even more than I originally needed because of how low the prices were! I definitely suggest SupplementWarehouse to anyone looking for health shakes, pre workout, whey, etc. What ever they needed SUPPLEMENT WAREHOUSE HAS IT!!",24,15-24,M

"So, if I want clothes, Yesstyle is my go to place. I rarely even go to stores anymore. I recommend this site to everyone.  If I had to say some downer points about the site it would only be that sometimes things can be a little pricey, but at the same time there are ALWAYS sales going on. So, just wait! Your favorite things may be on sale for you soon! Also, if you aren't ""Asian-sized"" or fairly slim (also with feet bigger than an 7.5/8 US) then you might be out of luck (except for things like some tops and of course their amazing accessories!) . It kind of goes a bit without saying though, it IS Asian style clothes. So, expect smaller asian sizes. In example, I am about a 2-4 pants size US and I had to buy the largest size pants they had. They were amazing pants though, and they fit perfectly! I LOVE YESSTYLE!<3",21,15-24,F

"I was looking to purchase a diamond for my girl friend and review numerous diamonds on the Brilliance sight. I made a choice and made my purchase. I received a call from a brilliance service rep, explaining to me what I purchased and why  the other Diamond I had also reviewed would be a better selection. difference in price was minimal but the value was far greater. I was again called by Brilliance asking me why I didn't select a mount. When I told them they had nothing I was interested in, they informed me that they could make anything. I put them to the test and I was floored by what they produced. I compared it to other designer rings costing 3 times what I paid. I will never buy diamonds or a ring anywhere else.

The item and price was great but it took too long to dispatch my item. If you order in the morning there should be no reason why your item should not be dispatched the same day. This is why is use merlin cycles 9 times out of 10. Often order at 7pm+ and it still comes next day !,33,25-54,M

"I booked an expensive room in NYC, planning to spend the night with two adults and two children.  The hotel informed me that no more than two people could be permitted in the room, and that only priceline customer service could fix the problem (by allowing their ""king room"" with sofa bed).   The other alternative of course was that I pay for an extra room at their exhorbitant price.    I called priceline customer service, which sounded like a call center in India, and after a long wait, they would do nothing more than read a passage to me saying that all rooms are nonrefundable.  No service at all, just delay and unpleasantness.   It is not okay when traveling to arrive at the hotel with tired children and find that you can not actually be permitted to stay in the room you already paid for.   (Fortunately,  we found out before actually leaving home, but feel cheated of quite a lot of money.)",48,25-54,F

"I've been ordering clothes from YesStyle.com for about 4 or more years now. If I had a choice to choose where to buy my clothes, I will always choose YesStyle. The sizes for clothing varies between each brand but all the dimensions are listed accurately in the description. This greatly helps me accurately choose my sizes. There's constantly new styles coming out and an endless selection to choose from. The only gripe I have about ordering from here is the amount of time it takes for me to receive my order. YesStyle has tried to compensate by offering free expedited shipping and having some items available to ship, but in order to get free shipping I usually have to buy multiple items which results in one of the items not currently in stock. Therefor my entire order has to wait until that item is ready to ship. Overall I still trust YesStyle as my #1 clothing source.",23,15-24,M

"Bought a Groupon to take a balloon flight with this company.  I lost count of how many times I called and left a message with no return call.  Then when I finally talked with someone, there were no weekend dates available in this century.  Then when I finally scheduled a date to go, and after I woke up at 3:45am and drove over an hour to make it to Temecula in time for a sunrise flight, I arrived to find out the flight was cancelled due to weather.  Strange... I saw at least eight other balloons flying in what could only be described as perfect conditions.  Fought with both Sunrise Balloons and Groupon to get a refund, in a frustrating but eventually successful battle.  But did I get refunded for all the time I spent including the trip to and from Temecula, or the gas I used?  Nope.  It cost me a lot of time and money to learn what I'm about to tell you: DON'T USE THIS COMPANY.",47,25-54,M
"Got a Groupon for a hot air balloon ride with Sunrise Balloons in Temecula.  First off, the deal claimed the value was $199 and the Groupon was for $99.  But later I discover that several other companies in the area - all of which have way higher Yelp ratings (Strike one) - all charge about $110 to $140.  So the ""value"" was substantially inflated.  Strike two.  Called the company to try to redeem and no one answered so left a message.  No response after two days.  Strike thee. Called again.  Voicemail again.  Called again, and again, and again.  Strike four, five, etc.  Finally got a hold of someone, who helped me schedule a flight for a date over a month away because none of the many dates I wanted were available.  Another strike.  When the fateful date arrives, I wake up at 3:45am and show up at the launch site at 5-something in the morning after driving over an hour to Temecula, No Sunrise Balloons.  So I call and - surprise - no answer.  When I finally talk to someone, they say they had to cancel due to weather.  What?  I saw at least 8 other balloons floating through the early morning sky on what could only be described as a perfect day.  Were they in different weather?  When I contacted Groupon for a refund, they told me that it is the nature of ballooning that sometimes flights cancel due to weather, and I needed to try to reschedule and only if I was not able to reschedule would I get a refund.  What about a refund for the frustration, and the gas I used to drive to Temecula?  Groupon needs to do a better job of A) choosing the companies they work with B) stating the actual value of the product or service and C) not ripping people off.",47,25-54,M

"ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!  My diamond could not be any more perfect!  I am floored with it's gorgeous sparkle and I can't put it down!  I was very hesitant to purchase online, however, I priced various stones out at *several* local jewelers for the past few months (that just so happened to be lesser quality) with the highest price being $22,000 and the lowest price being $14,500.  (I was searching for a 1.5 - 2 carat cushion cut, preferably square and I was willing to bend on color and clarity as long as it fit my certain requirements and caught my eye -- seeing as you're on this website and shopping diamonds, you know what I am talking about!)   I still can not believe the amazing deal I got on such a perfect diamond!  I ended up with a diamond that is *above and beyond* the size, clarity, and cut I was initially searching for for *significantly* less than what I would have paid at any local jewelers!  I will definitely be a return shopper and I recommend them to anyone! It was absolutely worth the wait!",26,25-54,F

"I'm editing my review to reflect what my experience has been since our case was taken up by Michael, the President of NSC. My fiance and I did have a number of difficulties with our order with this company (they are listed at the very bottom of this review), but our opinion has changed drastically since we were able to work with Michael. Our belief is that the vast majority of people who work with NSC receive a perfect order on the first go around and that when our order had problems, their existing infrastructure was really not adequate to deal with them. Now, I will say that I hope our rep has learned a lesson about how to treat customers because we were quite understanding and had very simple requests that she chose not to follow up on (emailing us when it arrived, calling us once it was time to re-do the ring for the third time, and making sure to look at the ring herself before it was shipped out). That said, our experience with Michael has absolutely been perfect. Not only was he incredibly apologetic over the phone to both my fiance and myself, individually, he also asked us both individually to explain exactly what had happened from our personal perspectives and really took the time to express to us how much he regretted what our experience had been. He offered us a 20% discount on our ring in addition to providing a written lifetime guarantee that we could send the ring back to be re-finished for no charge and also guaranteed that if we decided to change the band from platinum to white gold at some point in the future that his company would remake the band and refund us the difference in the costs of the metal. We chose not to accept the discount, though we appreciated that it was offered, because we never wanted to pay less for our ring -- we just wanted what we had ordered and we wanted someone at the company to care about us and our ring. We wanted to feel like we were being treated like people by someone who cared. Once we got in touch with Michael -- which we did on our first try this past Monday-- things were taken care of incredibly quickly. In fact, I am wearing my ring right now (it arrived last night along with a beautiful pendant necklace that Michael sent to apologize) and it looks perfect. I now regret that we spent so much time dealing with our rep and realize that we should have taken it higher up the chain much sooner. In spite of our frustrations, I still support this company because it is a small business and I really believe our experience was a reflection of the fact that it is experiencing growing pains. I'm sure our rep had tons of other orders she was dealing with and I really think that our experience was a wake up call for the company that they need to grow their staff in order to take on increasing demand. I really hope that no one else will have to deal with what we did, but at the end of the day we now have the ring that we wanted and we have the comfort of knowing that Michael is supporting us and is on our side. It's kind of funny how much it matters for purchases like engagement rings to be sure that the people you're buying from care not just about the money you'll be giving them, but about you. I'm leaving the basics of my original review below so that other customers can see what our experience was. Still, I am greatly comforted in having spoken with Michael personally and I am certain that this is a company with strong potential and with beautiful pieces to offer. I hope that my review will be an anomaly and that the company can learn and grow from our experience. My only advice would be that if other customers begin to face difficulties (which, again, I don't believe many do based on other reviews and also based on Michael's reaction, calling our experience ""his worst nightmare"" and expressing his embarrassment) they should make sure to elevate their order themselves. 1. We ordered a ring but they had to ship it undone because it was not completed in time for our engagement. We understood and sent it back to be finished an re-sized. Our rep then sent it back and it was finished, but they did not re-size it. Frustrated, we sent it back again. When we got it back it was re-sized but extremely dirty (black spots all over) and misshapen. This has led to me having a ring for about 3 weeks of our engagement of over 2 months. Frustrating. 2. Our rep was generally quite dismissive. When I would send my precious ring back to their store, I would ask her to inform me when it arrived. Each time I sent it back (via 2-day shipping) I had to contact her myself (five days later) to ask if the ring had arrived. The third time I asked that she call me to speak with me over the phone about my ring. She agreed she would. She never did. She also repeatedly used the excuse that she had many appointments and meetings to justify not calling me. *I have learned by talking to Michael that their reps do not work on commission so as to avoid situations like ours happening. As such, I have deleted what I had previously written about our rep dismissing us perhaps because she had already received her commission.",25,25-54,F

"I paid for The Secret World cd key as it was half the price other websites were asking. I paid via credit card and it all went through ok, however CDKey Warehouse contacted me to ask for further verification of my credit card details. This included a partial photocopy of my credit card. I refused to do this however and asked them to cancel my order if they couldn't verify it without this. I've since been sent my cd key and it works perfectly. I can only assume it was a mistake asking me for more details. Despite that hiccup the service has been prompt, the item cheap and it works as intended.

"As I said, selections and prices are fantastically great. Some improvements: 1. set up some guidance to help customers shopping, such as categorize products by ingredients, best selling and best reviewed. Otherwise, I have to view the list from other websites, e.g. bodybuilding.com, then come back to shop. You may lose your customers! 2. group different sizes and flavors of one product under one entry. The webpage looks messy if not.",22,15-24,M

"I am writing this review to help future or current customers. Trust me, do not use this company. There are so many other sites that I trust to sell, rent, and buy textbooks from. Textbooksrus claims that they did not quote me prices for my books before I mailed them all in. You have to be out of your mind to think that I would send in books that were worth (literally) hundreds of dollars if I wasn't sure I would receive a check! Isn't that common sense?! THEN, textbooksrus says that they only received one or two of my books...I sent about 10. They just ""didn't receive"" them. I do a ton of online shopping, sales, etc., and have NEVER had this happen. The few they received apparently ""did not match"" the ones I said I was sending. MORAL OF THE STORY: Spread the word, this company is a joke and they will LOSE YOUR BOOKS, SAY THEY DIDN'T QUOTE YOU PRICES ONLINE THAT THEY DID, AND CLAIM THEY NEVER RECEIVED YOUR BOOKS. It makes me sick to think these bitches are making a profit. Run, as fast as you can!",21,15-24,F

"When we bought our laptops I told my wife I was going to buy extended warranties from this company I heard about on Ebay (Square Trade). She thought it was a total wast of money. But I bought them anyway. My wife's laptop is her life,  If it's acting up she is very unhappy, so when it died a little over 2 years in. Square Trade had a.check to us for the full amount within days. Since she likes a laptop I gave her mine and bought an all in one for me. With only 3 months left in a 3yr. warranty we sent the other in because of several missing keys, it would randomly shut off and several other miner problems. What we got back was like a brand new laptop. They replaced everything main-board, keypad. hard drive optical drive, touch pad and more. They also replaced most of the case. It really is like getting a new computer. Square Trade is the real deal we couldn't be happier. We would highly recommend them.",60,55-64,M

"The website is easy to navigate, and it's awesome that the provide measurements for their clothes, especially for international costumers. That said, while their selection of clothes is pretty broad, their actual stock is shit. I wanted to exchange an item for a smaller size, but it was already sold out, even though I received it not even a week ago. What clothe items I save for later also end up being ""no longer available"" within a week or two. Costumer service isn't the best either.

"I will be brutally honest.  Booking my hotel was no problem but when it came to changing my reservation it was a nightmare.  I went to my account with my reservation details where I should have been able to change my reservation from 3 rooms to 2 rooms.  No matter how many times I refreshed the website or hit the buttons to change it, nothing happened.  So then out of frustration I tried to cancel my reservation by hitting the cancellation button.....many times....again nothing happened.  The next day I called their customer service....not much better.  The connection was terrible and because the reservation technically went through Expedia my customer service person had to call them and call me back to cancel one of my rooms.  This only took a few minutes but I never received an email receipt or confirmation code.  The next day I look at my account and it still has me listed as being reserved for 3 rooms.  So now I try calling back....and after calling about 10 times with no answer or answering machine to leave a message I just went straight to the source and called Expedia.  Expedia took care of my immediately and sent me confirmation code and email. Will never use this service again. And the nightmare continues.  A week after being promised a full refund I still had not received it and decided to call Easybook again....kill me now.  When you call Easybook not only do you have to wait forever but you have to listen to the most god awful sound while waiting.  It sounds like a broken alarm clock.  After waiting for ten minutes to finally talk to someone I was answered by a girl who couldn't hear me due to a bad connection.  Mind you I am calling from an iphone 5 that I never have problems with.  Then she has the audacity to ask me to call her back due to the bad connection. WTF!!! I finally got her to write down my phone number to call me back.  Of course 3 hours later I hadn't heard anything.  Then I called back and after waiting for 15 minutes and not being able to handle the alarm sound anymore I hung up. Highly encourage anyone thinking of using this site to think twice about their decision. Still waiting for my refund...wont hold my breath. Truly the worst customer service/ difficult company I have ever had to work with ever.",27,25-54,F

"Always been happy with myprotein's service and products. However, on my last order I was sent ""Mega Green Tea"" instead of ""Mega Cissus"".  Not the end of the world I grant you, however considering I've been a regular customer for many years I was not particularly pleased with the service I received to rectify the situation. I could either keep the green tea (worth £10 less than the cissus) and get 10% of my next order or return the green tea and get the cissus sent when my protein receive the green tea. Again not ideal; without trying to sound too arrogant, time is money, I'm very busy and don't want to be going to the post office to buy a jiffy envelope, printing out my free postage sticker etc. It wasn't my error, yet I have to make the effort to rectify everything. Just send me a new cissus!  you've made thousands off me over the years. Yes I'm making a fuss over nothing, however; as a loyal customer who needs his supplements asap (like every meathead worth his weight) I expected better service. A good company,  with excellent products but with a universal returns policy that doesn't suit everyone.",32,25-54,M

"Seth dropped his IPad when he was working at the shop last week and the screen cracked.  I told him not to worry because we had SquareTrade coverage on it.  I was able to go online, answer a couple of questions, and submit a claim.  Easy!   Very shortly after, I received an email from SquareTrade with a link to my shipping label.  I was able to print it out, package up the IPad, and drop it off the very same day.  They make it easy to track the progress of your repair and before I knew they let me know it was ready and wending it's way back home.  This was the third time we've had to have a device repaired and they've all gone very smoothly.  I wouldn't want to buy an electronic device without getting it covered by SquareTrade!",51,25-54,F
I have yet to find any one on the web or going to my local electronic shops that can beat Monoprice prices on any thing they sell. I need cable most of the time and even thou I am on the east coast and they on the west coast it gets to me in three business days every time and still it is cheaper to buy from them than locally.

I reported the incident to customer service at Global Parking and was told by two individuals, Carolyn and Amanda that unfortunately there was nothing that could be done about the expense that was incurred.  As an individual who travels frequently finding a reliable parking service is important.  When there is a break in communication with the hotel and the parking service the customer should be compensated for the inconvenience.

With brick and mortar stores often charging the full RRP for a game of £30+, or even the likes of Steam and Origin (EA) doing the same, CDKeyHouse provides the perfect safe haven for people with little in their wallets. It's easy to be sceptical about purchasing CD keys from what may appear to be random websites, potentially scamming websites, but CDKeyHouse is definitely the place to go if you want to feel safe making a purchase to save yourself a substantial amount of money (one example being Borderlands 2 sells on CDKeyHouse for £16 whereas in a store or on Steam it is £30!).

Not only did POP bring a buyer to the table, they worked the deal from start to fininsh.  Ever step of the process has someone in charge and keeps you in the loop.

"After a break-in next door (owner had a leading home security solution with central monitoring, which worked well), I was determined to find a cheaper way to get the same result.  I am a PhD electrical engineer, so I was sure I could do it myself.  And you can, but building your own gadgets and trying to figure out how to explain  to your family how to turn it on and off  (much less have the mess centrally managed by a monitoring service) is really not an option if you have a full-time job, etc. The geeky things you see on the internet (involving Arduinos and Raspberry Pi computers) are cute, but just not scalable (so far).   But, even if not going the ""geek route"",  I was still convinced I could find a better way than paying $$$$ to local area installers with central monitoring. That solution is Safemart's ""plug-and-protect"" system.  The way it worked for me is based on choosing a very good central control panel (the Simon XTi, which uses ZWave), inserting a GSM card (I ditched my landlines 7 years ago) to allow the battery backed panel to contact a central monitoring system,  and a number of sensors that you peel and stick around the house to monitor doors, windows, fire, whatever.  The process is very straightforward.  You go to a website and fill out a form with your ideas in mind as to where and how many sensors of each type you need.  After talking to Safemart, my order was shipped in a single box.  Setup was straight-forward.  Each sensor was labeled based on my initial choices (e.g. ""living room motion sensor"") and the panel was pre-programmed to ""know"" all of this. I have been inspired by the simplicity and transparency of the ""Plug-and-protect"" concept.  Adding and removing sensors is very easy, and gives you the control of a DIY solution, while preserving all the benefits of a professionally monitored solution.  They have great videos that walk you through almost anything you want to do in terms of expanding or changing your system.   I have purchased add-ons through eBay, and if there was an easy ZWave dev kit (they cost thousands of dollars at present), I probably could still make up my own gadgets. I have been happy with Safemart so far.  We had a defective sensor (it was way too sensitive) and they quickly replaced it within days.  We have had some false alarms, it was easy to work with the monitoring service to deal with them.  We have another 9-10 months, and we will after that not require a contract.  But as it looks, I don't see a reason to stop. There is one caution for people going this route, and it was a bit stressful, and that has to do with getting the local permit paperwork.  We found, in Albuquerque, that this is quite a painful bureaucracy, designed not for the DIY home security crowd but for the ""big guys"" and locals who do this professionally.  They were very unpleasant in dealing with my wife, who being an attorney does actually know how to read the fine print and wade through complex processes.  Even she found this to be an unholy mess.  Safemart kind of glosses over this, in my opinion, although I did find emails that mentioned it, which I didn't read carefully.  Most of this is beyond SafeMart's control, but I think it should be emphasized, blatantly if necessary, so that others do not have to go through the unpleasantness unaware. Other than the ordeal of permitting, however, I have been very happy with Safemart, their customer service, and the resulting system we have in our home.",52,25-54,M

"I bought 2 year SquareTrade warranties for both of my daughters new phones (an Iphone and HTC). Almost a year passes and my oldest is off at college, over 2000 miles away, and spills water on her phone. She cannot get it to work (tried the old rice in a bag trick to no avail). I am thinking, great, have to shell out for a new phone - until I remembered I had purchased a warranty for her phone. I contacted SquareTrade, explained the problem and was promptly sent an email with all return information. After paying the $99 deductible (much cheaper than paying $500 for a new smart phone) my daughter shipped it off for repair. This was right before Thanksgiving, so I was not expecting to get the phone any time soon. The day after Thanksgiving I receive an email that the phone is repaired and being shipped back! They even shipped it directly to my daughter at college rather than returning it to our home address. The phone works as good as new, making my daughter very happy.  I have bought several warranties with SquareTrade, but this was the first occasion I had to use one. I must admit I was very impressed with the customer service and turnaround time for repair.

I decided to check online and see if I could find any and was beyond surprised at yeswalker's selection and style. I've never bought anything online before but I will definitely be returning! The sales and shipping costs make everything perfect; this is something you don't find elsewhere. Waiting a couple weeks might be bothersome but it's worth it. Great shop!,15,15-24,M

"Shipped quickly - in time for Christmas (I was worried). The 8"" Twilight Android tablet has become a real workhorse for me. I keep all of my technical and parts manuals on it so, I use it almost daily for that and also to play movies and music. I can easily get onto the guest network at the hospital where I work and can do my email and web surfing when I want to. Often, people will stop and ask about the ""neat"" little tablet - I enthusiastically tell them about LightintheBox.com and the great deal I got.",33,25-54,F
"I highly recommend Priceline for hotel and car rentals. I have been pleasantly surprised a few times with hotel rooms. Once I was booked at a place I had already looked into and the quoted price was much higher than what I ended up paying through Priceline. I always rent my cars through them, too, and get the best price. I realize it's a gamble picking an area rather than a specific location. But, if I have a general idea of the area, it's worth the risk. I haven't been disappointed yet.",62,55-64,F

"We've ordered twice from Groupon and both times we have been severely disappointed. The first order was for 2 x dehumidifiers. We had no communication to let us know that they had been dispatched and then when one of them finally arrived 10 days later, we were left wondering when or if the second would turn arrive. I called Groupon customer services to query (If you want to waste an hour of your life, call the Groupon customer service line!) The girl I spoke to on the phone would not confirm whether 1 or 2 had been sent. I told her my parcel said 1 of 1 so could only assume that only 1 had been sent. She asked me to wait a couple of days for the second one to turn up, so I did and no luck. I called back and requested a refund....only to be told that they couldn't refund my card, but could offer me the funds back in Groupon credit! A few months later and we saw a pair of ballerina pump shoes in a snake skin purple/pink metallic print, with 90% off....who could pass up this opportunity! So we decided to give Groupon a second chance....(Famous last words!) The shoes took around a week to arrive....fair enough but yet again, no notification that they had been dispatched. When we received the item, the shoes were 2 different colours! One was purple/pink and the other was green/yellow! We have learned our lesson - the deals may be great but the customer service, delivery and general operations of this business are dire! For the sake of a saving, I'd rather spend a bit more and receive a good service than waste any more time with Groupon!",24,15-24,F

I was dumb and closed my laptop screen on my mouse.  After looking at numerous repair shops (Best Buy wanted $120 just to ship the laptop to see what's wrong with it [Duh!]) Laptopscreens.com showed up.  They had the exact model that I needed and even had the repair video!  I was totally surprised that the screen went to my house that week (I was elsewhere in the country and expecting the shipment to take longer)!  I only took 2 hours because I was watching YouTube videos as background while I did the repairs myself.  $70 for the screen and experience gained vs. $120+ in repairing at a shop.  Good deal.,28,25-54,M

I found that the prices were lower than any other I could find, and even if they were not then Supplement Warehouse would match that price. They give away free items with purchases and have reliable shipping. The product always arrives as described and shows maximum performance. I can trust this website to send me exactly what I order on the exact date that it shows on the shipping. One last note, the reason I truly love this website is because we are similar.

Daddy wanted to know the roots from which he came and I have spent 61 years searching for those in the past. If he could only see what I have accomplished to date he would be so amazed and thrilled. If you can find one name it can lead you to hundreds of people in your past. Sometimes they criss cross with others and come back to rest in your tree. It is amazing where you can find a cousin  an family member they are every where all across this country. So interesting how close we come to kings and queens, prates, men that rode in the quantrell raiders and so much of the history. I would recommend this program to every one you will find someone to add to your family unless you came from an alien planet.  I would recommend to get ancestry and start today to find out who that next king or queen or rugged outlaw you can claim in your family.",73,65+,F

"As the title suggests, this was my first time ordering from CJS CD Keys, not to mention pre-ordering Mass Effect 3 from them as well. Did my order just within hours before the pre-order status ends, and waited eagerly. Unsurprising, there were a lot of orders that CJS CD Keys need to fulfill and I am impressed with their dedication and tenacity in making that customers like me get it as soon as possible. It was unfortunate that it took them over 24 hours, but hey, considering the amount of orders coupled with a handful of people from CJS CD Keys, I see no reason why I should not be emphatic of their situation. Yet, they made it through and on the next day, I got my key in my mail, entered it into my Origin account and presto, downloading commences. Together with cheap prices and almost instant replies from the crew (dependent on your time zone, by the way), I am definitely one happy customer, will continue buying from them, and share this great service with my friends.",27,25-54,M

The sales team responded promptly to my questions and updated me on every stage of the delivery providing courier information in conjunction with UPS. They even told me which house the parcel was left at and the name of the neighbour that signed for the parcel!

"The customer service of Expedia is terrible! If you run into problems they will not help you at all.  After 5 hours on the phone talking to 5 different people, all I got was the phone number for the airline's customer service people! I have traveled using Expedia several times before.  This was the 1st time I needed to use their 1-800 number. My flight was canceled due to weather.  I called their number to find a solution. The agent on the other end told me that they would cancel my ticket if I found another flight. I found another flight and called back.  After waiting on hold with the agent for 2 hours, I was told that, because of the inclement weather, I needed to call back the next day before noon. I double checked to make sure that this would not be too late to cancel, but was assured that it would be fine. However, the next morning when I called at 6 am, I was told that it was too late and that my original flight had been re scheduled. I was on the phone with the person for 1/2 an hour explaining things before my new flight took off and I had to hang up. Once I was back in cell service, I called the number again. This time I was told their system was down and that I would have to call them back in 2 hours.  When I called them back I was on the phone again for another 2 hours until I was finally told that at no time could they have canceled the flight and that I should have contacted the airline directly right away!  When I pointed out that I had talked to 4 other people and none of them communicated this to me, I was told that they were sincerely sorry and that the people would be dealt with, but that there was still nothing they could do for me! I will never use Expedia for another flight. With all of the options out there, you can do better than this site.",28,25-54,F

"Similiar to other comments, had the laptop about 32 days and getting it ready for son's college start the next day.  Opened the screen and shattered.  Of course Best Buy wouldn't accept it as a return (last time I ever shop there but that is another story).  Manufacturer (Levono) apparently had issues with this screen.  Instead of wasting more time, I ordered from Laptopscreen now for about $65 and in about 3 days it showed up at my door.  Very simple to replace the shattered screen and works like a charm.  I recommend Laptopscreen now to all my friends and I will use them if I am ever in this position again.",48,25-54,M

"Hello, I won't lie I'm pretty disappointed with the product, The advertised photo made the case appear as 'TARDIS' Blue that blends with a bright blue image of the TARDIS on the back. The case I received was black with the same TARDIS door photo however it was much duller and appears to have been simply cut and glued on the back. The case seems sturdy enough however I believe the advertised product to be an unfair representation of what is actually received. Thanks -",23,15-24,M

The process was laid out clearly and the checklist they provided helped to ensure everything was sent.  Sabrina was very helpful and explained everything in detail.

"With so many options, I didn't really intend to use one site over the other.  But when I had to make plans short-notice to an event that would certainly constrain area vacancy, the same hotels came up over and over.  I found the one I really wanted to stay at, and must have been a popular choice as no other site was able to book the room.  I remained persistent that this was the hotel I wanted to stay at, and came across Priceline.  To my surprise, I was able to book the exact room I wanted.  Not 100% willing to trust the internet, I immediately called the hotel to confirm my reservation, and was pleased to find out that I was booked.  I don't know if they use voodoo, or I just happened to click as someone updated their vacancy, but they got me in, and $20 cheaper than the price I was quoted at the other sites that couldn't book it.",30,25-54,M

About 2 months after installing a 3 valve shower I started having problems with the valves not working properly.  The water company had been flushing the water main coming to my house and some debris got stuck in the valve.  This wasn't Hudson Reed's fault but they walked me through how to fix it.  I tried to do as they said but it didn't seem to help.  So they sent me a complete replacement valve at no cost.  I installed it and the problem went away.  The shower works as if did in the beginning again and I couldn't be happier.  Thank you for your help.,58,55-64,M

"Overall this is my go-to trip planner. The website is very user friendly and gives multiple choices and ways to sort the options that are given to you. I love love the express deal feature which allows you to get a hotel at a price that is unheard of--most of the time far less expensive than standard. The one downfall is the customer service. When I spoke with a woman she acted as if I was wasting her time with my questions and concerns about a recent hotel I had booked. On that same note, the cancellation policy could be improved --especially when booking with express deals. All in all a good website for getting deals on hotels, flights, and rentals.",24,15-24,F

"Ancestry.com is great for so many different applications.  I have used it not only to find my family history but also to search for my classmates (find married names, etc.), and help a friend who is adopted locate her birth family.  The types of information available are amazing.  I've found pictures, newspaper articles with vital information as well as great stories, information shared by my relatives (most I've never met before), and so much more.  Ancestry has recently added Texas Death Certificates, which tell birth dates as well as death dates/locations and cause of death.  I found out one of my direct ancestors changed his last name, and that several others were important military figures.  Just give it a few bits of family information and you're off with hints of all sorts.  This is definitely the go-to site for researching family history. Oh, did I forget to say I even had my DNA run through this site?",60,55-64,F
"When my laptop screen cracked, I was pretty bummed. I really wanted to solve the problem myself, but every website I visited indicated it would cost ~$700 to have it repaired, and most recommended just buying a new computer at that point. Furthermore, I found lots of sites saying that it was practically impossible to do yourself without experience. Luckily, my friend recommended this site, and I found the right screen for my model in seconds, along with multiple instructional videos for replacement! Once I ordered it, I was extremely surprised to see it at my door 2 DAYS LATER (and I even chose the cheapest shipping.) I followed the video on the site, and replaced the screen myself in less than 20 minutes, and it worked perfectly! I'm so happy and would recommend this site to anyone.",25,25-54,F

I am able to compare hotel rates and filter hotel facilites based on my client's needs. All the features are great! I find the map very helpful and I print it out for my clients to show them the exact location of the resort. When I'm organizing a wedding or a small event and my chosen hotel is fully booked, I just search through the other hotels on the map, give the available options to my clients and show them which hotel is more accessible or affordable. This site also has an excellent review system which is very hard to find nowadays.",26,25-54,F

"Would probably been easier to buy a new bird box already fitted with a cam but anyway, after getting electricity (we didn't want batteries to run out mid season) to the cam in the box via the loft and electricity in situ where we wanted the wireless unit in the lounge, setting up the rest of it was amazingly easy and worked first time. A bit more written instruction would have been useful to overcome every eventuality but we were lucky that one of us is slightly technically minded. I get the feeling that everybody selling high tech stuff whether a mobile phone, web cam or a lap top thinks that knowing in detail how it all works should be instinct to all. It is not. All in all the bird cam was a good purchase. Just want some warm weather now so the birdies actually know what time of year it actually is.",54,25-54,F

One tie ended up having a blemish on the front when I received it. I snapped a picture and sent it off to the customer service line and within a few hours had a response that they had sent me a new tie and I should proceed to donate the second tie to Goodwill. It was a nice surprise and easy to handle as opposed to sending it back, waiting for the re-shipment etc. I give them a +5 star for service, but put a 4 star down since one of the ties ended up being of poor quality.",28,25-54,M

He was really patient because I didn't know much about security and helped me get exactly what I needed (even talked me out of a few items that I would have bought if he hadn't told me otherwise).

"I've tried so hard to contact PartsGeek.com by phone but to no avail. Have I known that this is just an e-mail based contact, I should have avoided to buy parts from them. I received a wrong part, simply because they have only one choice of this part. They did not tell you that there are other parts for this same make, yr. and model of this car. In other words, they just give you one choice. I am referring to the Headlight assembly of my 2007 GMC Acadia. The picture in the website is right, but the connectors are different. They did not show that. This company is supposedly in the business for many years and yet, not so perfect of what they are selling. I'm too frustrated and disappointed about my purchase experience with PartsGeek.com. Now.., I have to sacrifice returning the items in big boxes and to pay for all the return expenses such as freight, re-stocking fees, etc. for their mistakes. And for your information.

"I  had a short break holiday earlier this year and one of the things I did was visit a museum in Liverpool,there I saw an in my opinion  the most beautiful painting .On my return home I could not get this painting out of my head so I set out to find it and came across 1st-art-gallery.com.I placed my order and when it came I was speechless the likeness is wonderful ,it means so much to me and I thank the artist who painted  it .If like me anyone is wanting a painting I dont hesitate in recommending this  gallery .Only thing I would say is be prepared to wait a while if your painting is in oil because it takes a while for it to dry but it is well worth the wait.thank you so much for my painting",61,55-64,F
"Found these guys by accident, their prices were amazing but even if they are a little more than another supplier, you can INSTANTLY price match AND they give you another 5% off the competitor's price!  Unheard of!!!  I will be getting all my supplements from them for a very long time!!",51,25-54,M

"I have used SW multiple times for various supplements and they almost always have what I want in stock, and their price match/beat technology is good- if you find a better price and SW beats it, it usually covers their higher shipping costs. HOWEVER I have had two products' price matches overturned/cancelled by SW, despite researching and finding the prices online at stocking vendors. One was for Amazon.com, which I guess they don't consider a competitor. The other was for another site (can't remember the name offhand) that seemed like a legit source. The email that SW sends out is not specific, but states general policy. It would be awesome if SW would compile a database on their side and incorporate into their price match/beat tool so that these are not approved through the site BEFORE you place your order. In some instances this could save people a lot of money and head ache.",33,25-54,M
"This is a cool system, and the service is great.",50,25-54,F

But, of course the actual product was horrible! 1. Site description of the material was completely off! 2. Picture on the site was also different from the actual item. 3. Buttons were not even sowed on.. they were tied on -.-",20,15-24,F
"I booked a room at Cleveland clinic to take my mother to a heart specialist. The date of our appointment changed and I called expedia to modify my reservation. The representative who answered spoke little English and I have to believe the call was routed overseas. I was told that the computers were down and that I would have to call back. Over a two day period, I called nine times and was told each time that I would have to call back. I explained that I was trying to modify the reservation by six o'clock and was advised that there would be no problem. When I finally was able to get though the next day, I was advised that I would be charged for that night and for a block of four nights even though we were only staying for two. I will never consider using this company again.",44,25-54,F
"If  you want one of the best Genealogy Programs, please try Ancestry.com.  I've been using it for a bunch of years, and have not found anything better.  I started with a well organized set of scraps of papers, etc. that needed to be organized in a Genealogy Program.  Not having a program, back in the 1980's, I started my own setup in a Wordprocessor, and used that to basically get everything put together in a computer, so that we had some organization.  Finally, we got involved with Family Tree Maker, and got some organization.  Then we made a Gedcom disk and got involved with Ancestry.com and now there is no turning back.  I still use my M/S Word format, daily, as it gives me the opportunity to ATTACH my data to e-mails.  The satisfaction that I get from my Family Tree People, is great.  Some of them, after a while, can no longer afford the Genealogy Programs, and are kept up in the system with my M/S Word attachments. My family originated in Kilkenny, Ireland, then to Montreal, Quebec, then to Ontario, Canada, then my fathers family moved to Buffalo, NY in 1915.  So, as you can see, with me living in Buffalo, there are many e-mails back and forth between cousins and friends in Ontario.",83,65+,M

"My husband and I had a very pleasant experience with Veterans United and I would highly recommend them to any veteran looking to buy a home. From the pre-approval process to closing, our loan officer Josh tried his very best to keep us updated every step of the way. We did hit a few snags along the way, but once we knew what we needed to do to get the process moving along again it was back to smooth sailing. This was our first home, so as you can imagine we had lots of questions and it was very comforting to know that an answer was just an email or phone call away. Most times our emails/phone calls were answered by the end of the business day and occasionally the next business day. We had a family member going through the home-buying process at the same time we were. Needless to say her experience was a nightmare compared to ours. We are very grateful we chose Veterans United as our lender.",32,25-54,F

"I bought this  Bed Bath and beyond card on Saturday at 3pm and wondered when I was gonna get my gift card code. I checked my email because I wanted to go to the vendor soon and buy something. I called the ""customer service"" number and asked [Name] when I would receive my code and she said  it was a weekend and  it might be as long as Monday. She said the bank info needed to be processed first. But  then said I had already been charged but I might not receive the code until Monday because they are low on staff. Why can the staff process my $ but not give me the code immediately. Thats a scam. We have enough staff to process but not to give you the code you need is what essentially is the response. You can tell what the priority of giftcards.com, and it is definitely not the customer, but their $. If I buy discounted gift cards on line again I will not be using giftcards.com. If you care you will respond to this complaint at clintmmartin@gmail.com. I then wanted to cancel the gift card with [Name] IF i wasn't going to receive the code today, she then said it would take 3-5 business days to cancel (But you can get my $ so quickly, hmm). Well, I might as well wait for the code now and instead of getting this done on a weekend I will have to wait until the weekday when I work. You guys need some serious work, I would love to tell about yall on social media.",30,25-54,M

No less than 6 people gave me improper directions resulting in countless hours of trips to notarys only to find out I was sent the wrong forms. Beside the frustration in dealing with company employees who were not knowledgeable of their services the emotional trauma of having to revisit dealing with my deceased sons account was crushing. I felt entitled to some compensation for their bumbling this sensitive situation and while I received a letter stating they grossly mishandled my claim they would not offer any good will gesture to make up for my time and emotional hurt.

"This is now the second time I order a game from CJS and they fail to deliver. I dont understand how a company can afford to be so incompetent with so much competition on the market. I guess they don't want to stay in buisness for too long. They don't respond to mails. Their support system is broken. They send duplicated keys (same key to multiple people). They claim to have keys in stock when they in fact do not. Do not give your money to this shady company. The low price is not worth it, and there are other companies on the market who sell their products just as cheap. EDIT: You can always make excuses for your incompetence, but the bottom line is that you made a promise which you defaulted on, or in other words, displayed incompetence. Blizzard not delivering the game boxes is not my problem. I do not import the game. I do not claim to be able to supply anyone who wants with a CD KEY. That is what you do. It is your job and your responsibility to make sure it happens, not mine. You can not place the burden of service on the customer.  That is a degenerate attitude of doing business and like I said, I do not expect you to remain a business for too long. Not only that but I see no excuses for why keys were duplicated, why you  do not respond to mails, and why your support system is broken. Do you not even try to relieve yourself of guilt on these matters? Have you accepted your level of service as ""pathetic""? Or worse, do you think your customers will accept this level of service?",22,15-24,M

Also i have a fedex office 3 mins from my house they would not leave it there i could have drove to the west coast and picked up my box myself.

I contacted the Sunglasses-Direct and they asked me to mail them back for an exchange at my expense.  As they didn't have any in stock, I had to wait a week for them to order some new ones from Italy.  Should have had my postage refunded in my opinion as effectively had to wait a week and return at my expense (£7.50!) Other than that, cracking service.  Would definitely recommend and use again!

So I found Goggles4U online and immediately found frames i liked - and they were free - EVEN BETTER!  but I have run into issues getting a progressive lens with prism - either they arent done at all OR they are an additional charge.  but not here, here they were not only done but they were done at no additional charge.

"i was very excited to finally find a frame i liked that was reasonably priced so i ordered from selectspecs right away once i made my decision.  that was 7/25/12.  they shipped out in a reasonable time but now have sat in the sorting office of USPS for 2 weeks.  SelectSpecs will not inquire with USPS to find the source of the delay.  and i have been told that I will get them ""sooner or later"".  When i asked what would happen when i didn't receive then they said that they would remake them after 25 days and then ship them out again.  with the same shipping service that lost them in the first place.  unless i want to pay more for them to ship fedex or dhl. No, I am not responsible for the package being lost, I will not pay for the shipping that is guaranteed.  These are prescription glasses.  These are a different prescription than i have had before because my vision is worse.  not having the new prescription is costing me work.  And again they will not even make a postal inquiry.  I'm now at the point of dispute for non delivery of goods as my only recourse.",44,25-54,F

"I'll be honest, I haven't even received the product yet (Cupuacu capsules), but we placed the order on May 19, and it is now June 10.  It didn't even ship until June 3, with no contact from VitaSprings saying the order was delayed, or out of stock, or whatever the issue was (if there was one).  They are in California, and I'm in NJ.  A regular piece of mail usually takes 2-3 days (I know, I have a friend in CA).  By tracking, I can see it finally made it to NJ on June 6 and has bounced around the state.  Now this, I know, isn't VitaSprings fault, but regardless, this product should not have taken 3 weeks to get to me.  Unfortunately, I'll have to order elsewhere next time.",48,25-54,F

"My story short. In the end of May 2012 we contact customer service with uredanmark.com. I ask about delivery of a ferrari watch which our son was surpose to have for a pressent. A watch that I cannot purchase in Denmark. Customerservice asures me that they have the right watch in stock and that we have no reason to worry, because they have no reason to desive us. We transfer money by west union, after checking ofcourse that everything is in order. We then writte back to Uredanmmark that we have transferd the monney. They reply that they will send the watch quickly. After getting the wrong track and trace number and waiting for serveral weeks we finely recieve the watch in the mittle of July. Unfortunatly it is not the rigth watch but a cheap Eiky watch with a stell wristband. I writte to customer service again, who tells me not to return the watch since it will be very expensive and if I will be kindly anough to send them a picture of the wrong watch. I do that and they return to me on mail an regret what has happend and to compensate the mistake they will give 20% on my next purchase. I respond to them that it is not my mistake and that I am sorry, but I will not purchase from them again and that since it is theire mistake they should just send me the right watch without charge. This last mail I got no reply on. After having send the same e-mail til uredanmark.com I promised to montion my experiences here on the website. I allso contacted them customer service by using another e-mail and ask if they had my watch in stock and how long it would take to deliver and how to compare it to the Eiky watch witch was send to us by mistake. They where very positive until I wrote who I was. Since my last conversation with uredanmark I have send my e-mail to them allmost every day and I still haven´t recieved an answer. I hope that from this story you will be aware not to purchase anything from this company. I think that uredanmark.com, ureudsalg.com are related so I expect that you will experience the same treatment from them as well.",36,25-54,F

"We purchased a chain saw and was told it would be delivered in the week commencing 12th May. It was actually delivered a week early which meant by the time we were home to look at it the 7 days for a refund had already passed. When we put the chainsaw together it was faulty so we contacted UKHS and were told someone would call us back, after 3 hours we called again and were told the same thing and after a further 3 hours we called again and were yet again told someone would call, no one did. On Saturday we called again and was told someone would call us back and after 4 hours no one had (yet again) so we called again and was told the people we would need to speak to would probably have gone home so we should call back on Monday. I then logged a dispute with paypal as I had purchased the item with paypal and on Monday was called by a very rude man who said he wanted to sort out the issue and had the cheek to say we should have called before setting up a dispute on paypal and then accused us of lying about the previous calls because in his words ""he can't see why the message wouldn't have been passed on"" The man was most unhelpful and told us we needed to send the item back or he wouldn't do anything (which we obviously would have done but paypal were now dealing with the matter so we waited for them to tell us to do so) Paypal favoured me in the dispute and finally gained my money back however the service from UKHS was extremely rude and unhelpful, they are interested in selling and nothing else so if you do decide to purchase with them (which I wouldn't recommend) then you will need to hope your items aren't faulty as they definitely won't assist you in returning the item.",30,25-54,F
"Went on a website to compare the price of trading in my phone and could get the best price here (almost £20 more than the closest other offer and nearly double some!) Put in my phones details, confirmed all my details and requested payment by BACS and was told it would take 2 working days to process.  I then posted my phone by special delivery on Thursday so guaranteed to arrive Friday, the money was in my account on Tuesday which considering it was a bank holiday was great. A seemless experience and I would highly recommend.",29,25-54,F

"I ordered 2 tickets to see Ricky Hatton at the MEN arena on 24th November. When I realised the fight was happening I wasn't sure if I would be able to get the time of work and by the time I realised I could they had all sold out so couldn't book the tickets directly. I looked around various sites but chose to buy them from Double8tickets.com for two reasons. Firstly being specialists in front row tickets I knew I would get some great tickets with a good view and secondly they were more reasonably priced than all the other websites. I paid around £80 above face value and other websites were almost double this! I booked tickets that guaranteed first 10 rows and when they arrived they are row C which is just 3 rows back so I am over the moon! This was the 2nd time I use double8tickets.com and would not hesitate to use again, last time was to see Backstreet Boys at the o2 and I had better seats for this than I did when I sent to see Glee which I booked through American Express and had ""prefered seating"" Cannot recomend them enough. x",28,25-54,F

"I've ordered from this website many times and am very satisfied every time. I've only ordered boots from them (knee-high and mid-calf). I have larger calves, but mid-calves always fit fine. For knee-high boots I always check the measurements (they give you the circumference of the opening) and buy boots with larger measurements. I had bought a pair of boots with a 14"" circumference and though they were tight they loosened up a bit after walking around in them. Their sizes are true. I am a size 5-6 but I order a 6 so the calf area is a tiny bit bigger.",21,15-24,F
"I found a 50% off code and bought 4 dresses. Normally I wear an XL (14-16) but most of the clothes on the site are S-L, and according to the size chart their sizes run smaller than normal (Large is 10-12). I ordered all the dresses in Larges but made sure they were all made of rayon, polyester, or spandex which are stretchier materials. All four dresses fit well. I have thick thighs so it's a tiny bit tight down there, but not too tight. 2 of the dresses were completely see through, but they were white and cream color (I would stay away from those when ordering from this site). The dresses are also a little short, but when ordering from a clubwear site I kind of expected them to be. Although the material is cheap, all of the dresses are very cute and I am satisfied. I ordered February 25 and received them today, March 2. I received my confirmation e-mail the same day I ordered and they e-mailed me with a tracking number on the 27th. Three of the dresses were $9.99 and one was $12.99. With the 50% off code the total was $21.48 and shipping was $14.48. Grand total - $35.96.",21,15-24,F

I don't have to worry about them screwing me over later on, finding out that they signed me up for some membership that they charged my bank account for. They offer products that I can try, often for free. I wish all the other websites we're this easy to use. In my book, Supplement Warehouse even beats Walmart! Best prices around....",44,25-54,F

"I have used B&H for thousands of dollars worth of purchases and am absolutely baffled by my recent experience with their used department.  I bought a used Nikon D600 with an 8+ rating.  When it arrived I went over it and noticed that the function button did not work.  Looking closer, I found that this was because the front plate had separated on the right side of the camera by about 4mm, and there was a crack in it!  Hardly what I would consider light cosmetic wear!  I spoke with Jake from customer service and he was probably the only reasonable person there.  We set up a couple of plans for what could be done about it.  He advised me to send a detailed description of the situation along with photographs, which took several hours of my time to do.  He then told me that the email was checked daily and that someone would be on it very quickly.  This is a big concern of mine because I need a D600 body for a wedding I have in only 10 days.  After 2 days, I call them and the grumpy guy who conveniently slurred his name tells me that I need to wait for the email to be replied to.  I tell him that my case is particularly time sensitive, as was specified in the email and to Jake, who works there.  After a bit of hesitation, he takes my information and places me on hold for about a minute.  During this time (he states) he looked over the case, read my entire detailed description, looked over the photos, and showed the photos to his boss, who in turn told me that he will not change the rating on the camera, and that I should just send it back.  I have now lost close to a week between ordering and shipping because I wanted to go with a company I trusted.  During this time I have been asked to do a bunch of footwork and have gotten nothing in return.  I'll just say to that: if I ran my photography company like the used department ran their customer service, I wouldn't be in business for long.  Word to the wise, don't buy a D600 camera body with an 8+ rating, because it's probably going to go right back on the website and not be described as something with a significant defect in a body that costs $1250.  If I worked for B&H, I would sort the jokers in used department out before they caused any more damage to their reputation because this is not the company I am used to working with!  On the plus side, the return seems to be going very smoothly now that I have decided on that option!",29,25-54,M

"Tried to do an online claim-would not go thru, so I had to call, got little help from the guy on the other end of the phone. He told us to go to the apple store 30 miles away, so they could fix it-after I told him it was bent, broke the glass out and was separated- of coarse Apple could not fix it and would not take it in trade because it was so badly damaged. Called square trade back - they could not help me because the system was down. The next day called back and they said they would do a payout-still have not seen the check, oh and according to them my 2 year policy that I barely had for year is cancelled-nice. If the guy I had talked to the 4th time would have helped me first it might have turned out better.",20,15-24,M

"Yesstyle's a pretty cool online site where you can get fashionable clothes from asia. A lot of the fashion you can find on the website is something you can't find here (in America). The site doesn't present itself like other online retail shopping websites we're used to. Sometimes depending on the brand, they show pictures of models wearing the clothes within an environmental context -- like for example, a girl would wear a certain outfit sitting down having coffee. It's a bit more inspiring when it's presented that way. The only bad side is the standard shipping price is a bit steep but they do have some items that ship within 1-2 days. Some of their brands don't offer many sizes and mostly cater to an asian build. But hey, what can you do?",26,25-54,F

I found my local branch and the person I spoke to on the telephone was really helpful and said they could post it out in time (even though only had 2 days!!) and will be delivered the next day, but I wanted to try it on so I went to collect it. They reserved mine and two male outfits for friends in the sizes I needed for the end of the day. When I got to the warehouse the lady was very helpful and let me try on my outfit.

"We found a bunch of things for our wedding on the site.. my veil, flasks and gifts for bridesmaids/groomsmen, a nice clutch purse.  Delivery was prompt and the items were as advertised.  We were pleased.  What we did not like was that we got charged an extra 50$ canadian on a total bill of only $105.  We were not expecting this charge and no-where on the website did it warn us of the possibility that we might have to pay duty charges.  I understand the charges, but a little heads-up would have been nice.",36,25-54,F

"I placed a order for flowers and chocolates for a friend in hospital, however when I asked my friend about the delivery I found out it never arrived. I contacted iflorist first via email and then live chat, as no phone numbers, who confirmed order had not been sent. I asked why not sent and why did they not inform me. Said problem with florist and didn't answer on why did not inform me. It was agreed that the order would be resent to my friend, now at home, but order would be upgraded. So a week after original delivery date a order did arrive, but not with the chocolates as I had ordered. I have emailed iflorist about this, wrote on their Facebook page, but have has no response! Very upset over my treatment from this company and their not only lack of customer service but how they can get a order wrong twice and still not respond about this. Would not ever take the risk again of using this company.",44,25-54,F

However, the despatch note was attached to the front of the package in such a way that my special delivery instructions (in the event that I was out) were not visible, so the package was not delivered and I had to collect it later from the main post office.  If the facility to give special delivery instructions is offered, it surely makes sense to make the instructions visible?",64,55-64,M
I ordered a Beautiful Half Swing Golf Trophy A342 and it was delivered promptly.  I was disappointed with the trophy in terms of the look and the finish - I had been unable to verify this in detail on the website because the photo was too small and not enlargeable.  I took the matter up with the company and was heard courteously and offered alternatives at the same or a slightly higher price.

"Hi! Just wanted to let you know that I have just the right site for your next vacation or last minute getaway. Priceline!

They give you all the details that your could possibly need to make the right choice for your travel needs. They have it all! Hotels, motels, rental cars and flights! One stop shopping! And if you are worried about not getting the right price, look around! I guarantee that Priceline has already got it. Believe me, I have shopped around after I found a deal on Priceline and Priceline still had them beat or they had the same deal. But one difference is that Priceline has the ratings as well as the details for each and every place that they list. So give them a try! I bet you will love it!",49,25-54,F

Sent a parcel via this company through p4d. The pick up time was great and everything looked like it went well. Until the parcel was received by my friend. They say they use 'machines' so make sure you parcel is strong and secure which I did. The box had a big rip in and most of the items I sent which were secure were smashed to pieces! Also I wasn't impressed with the tracking service which suggested my parcel had been sat in a van for hours. Not really what I'd expect from £10+ secure postage! Finally got my money back because of p4d but this took 2 months because the wouldn't reply to emails or send forms back! The only thing that was good was the time it took to deliver the item... but when it's been smashed to pieces that's not much to rave about,24,15-24,F

I highly recommend using Giftcards.com. I have used them several times. I have used the beautiful visa cards and also created my own using photos. They are extremely prompt on shipping out the cards.

Again do not hesitate to use this site.  You will not be disappointed.,59,55-64,F

The hotel was booked so the gentleman I spoke to told me he could book me in the same type of room at the Candlewood Inn and Suites.  When we got the hotel (after driving for 12hrs with an 11yr old and 19 month old) I was informed that I was booked in a Queen Suite not a King Suite and none of the rooms had the sofa sleeper I had requested.  After about 45 mins of trying to get everything straightened out my family and I ended up going down the road and staying at another hotel chain.  I was very disappointed in all the miscommunication.  The only thing that was done right was my money being refunded back to my charge card.",33,25-54,F

Then, we needed to add another driver to our rental car, and as of three days trying using the phone and internet address - Feedback, nothing has been done by this useless travel agent.

"I recently found myself in need of a window switch for my car. I thought about doing a crude fix by using some glue and a lot of patience; that did not turn out so well. When I figured out that the switch could actually be removed by popping it out of the door handle with a screwdriver, I found myself asking where I could go to find a new window switch; going through the dealer seemed like the likeliest answer; however, I decided to look up websites that sell original factory equipment and that is when I found PartsGeek. At first, I was unsure about the authenticity of the website but as I browsed through the page, I found my fears allayed and located the part I was looking for. Sure, I think for a window switch, it was a bit on the pricy side but then again, I own a BMW. So I decided to give it a try, ordered the part I needed and withing a few days (I think less than a week) the package arrived at my doorstep. I wasted no time in testing it out and it worked right out of the box! PartsGeek truly lives up to its catchphrase: ""The Dealer Alternative.""

"I ordered a men's peasant shirt (useful in pirate wear, Renaissance festival costumes, etc). The quality was better than I had expected - it is very well and durably made. The men's large would probably fit someone who weighs four times as much as I do, and I may have to take it in a bit so that it isn't ungainly, but I'm a slim build and the fit is supposed to be blousy after all.  Also delivery was better than expected. I paid $2 more for priority shipping, and it arrived the day after it was shipped (halfway across the US). Their shipping rates are reasonable - apparently because they ship via USPS, which can be unreliable, but in this case it was more than excellent.",100,65+,M

I absolutely love my newly purchased Rolex watch! I bought it last week from Melrose Jewelers and I haven't stopped wearing it since! I had been looking for one for about four months before I finally found the perfect one on Melrose's website. I read their reviews online and they where all good which I found to be true once I got mine. I payed a very modest price for the watch I got. I was willing to pay much more being that other companies where asking for almost twice of what Melrose was asking for. I can't wait to get another one!,21,15-24,M

"Hey, just thought I'd give my own review as I read really mixed reviews N was kinda worried about buying, but did so anyway, and it has actually worked out fine. I had to order with my address and put country as Denmark as said couldn't deliver to UK on site, however thru private contact they said they will if you order with Denmark as country, then contact them by email soon after and ask them to change to UK. They shipped within a couple of days and were always spot on RE contact, always replying within a few hours about all my queries. I DID use a prepay visa card just to not risk my actual bank details etc. Soon as they sent. they sent a message with tracking number for DHL from India. Have still not taken medicine but will update if works, all packaging looks legit though and versus £500 IN uk, PAYING ABOUT £45  inc. delivery was a god send! hope this helps someone :)",29,25-54,F

Square Trade is like no other warranty place. There is no waiting from what I have experienced. After submitting my claim I received a response to my claim within a few hours.

He kept in contact with me to provide updates over a couple of weeks while they searched. He ended up giving me store credit for the shorts, even though UPS never located my package.

On reconnection, 20 seconds later, the site stated that I could no longer retrieve these details from their server but fortunately The Company had emailed me these details to so I was able to retrieve them from the attachments to the email. Otherwise, really easy to book the parcel delivery and make payment. Sensible and helpful options (delivery time estimates, insurance, text on delivery) were available for a competitive price. Collection was efficient and all I await is safe delivery of the parcel (and a refund as it was a return!).",57,55-64,M

I have never had a problem with ordering or speedy delivery!

"Got the item fairly quickly which was a top, it's a shame it didn't fit me what-so-ever, I called them to return it which was fine and they gave me a reference number. I expected a refund a few days later which they gave me as store credit (I guess I should have read the fine print before I ordered), I rang them to sort out a refund which they said I'd get after about 20 minutes of explaining that I couldn't fit into any clothes on the site which i actually wanted, 3 weeks later and still didn't receive it. In the end I gave up and just bought 2 hats I didn't really want just to burn the credit which was now useless to me. Fast delivery gets a + Tracking your order is another + Easy returns was a + No refunds and store credit only was a - Make sure anything you ordered will fit you and you'll have a pleasant experience, if you're like me though and can't fit into the clothes then you'll have lost your money.",24,15-24,M

"I had my mailed in gift cards rejected for ""irregularities"". Got nothing more than, ""If you'd like them back, send a self-addressed stamped envelope..."". Furthermore, was able to get through to ""Customer Service"" but there was only one lady avail. who had the authority to help me, I was told. Waited for my promised ""call back"" and called in again, only to be told, ""She'll call you on Monday"" (from Sat. eve). To make a long story short, between Daniel K. here (often replies to reviews here) and Patricia someone, we got it all straightened out. Mr. Big, the CEO or some such even called me, and to his probable mild embarrassment, he was a bit behind events, bec. I'd already been assured I'd get a check from the cards (made me think, ""NOW what!"" ). But, he was trying to see that a customer was either  satisfied, or if not, given an explanation as to why things happened as they did. Between Daniel and Patricia, I was pleasantly surprised (""astounded"" would be better) at their determination to have a satisfied customer. Very rare. In reading reviews, it would seem, to use moder parlance, that there are ""opportunities for improvement"" in the customer service end. Patricia explained to me what the ""irreguarities"" were & a few more ins & outs of the business. I had a happy ending, but had I eventually been rejected, I'd have to say there ARE people in the company who truly want their service to be a satisfying and fulfilling experience. I told Mr. Big I'd come back here and edit or update my previous not-so-nice review. Thanks Daniel, Patricia, & Mr. Big / ultimately a satisfied customer here... Tim S.",53,25-54,F

The clothing I purchased on here was exactly what I was looking for. They are so cute and of great quality. Even my mother is interested in buying. I was a little worried about the ""one size fits all"" but the items fit me perfectly. i also loved how the clothing was carefully packaged. It was obvious that the company cares about the product and their customers too. That gave me more peace of mind when ordering again. I just put in another order.

"The several faxes/ e-mails I've sent to Expedia since yesterday: Yesterday I tried to book a trip Chicago with my Visa DEBIT card. In Canada, it is a debit bank card that allows us to make online purchases. At the end of my booking, I was informed that the order would not be processed and I assumed it was because it was a debit Visa, not a credit card Visa. An hour later, I noticed on my online banking that Expedia had withdrawn $919.40 from my BANK ACCOUNT. I was on the phone last night several times and spoke to several people. I was on hold for a total of 78 minutes. NO ONE would listen to me and kept insisting it was just a credit card authorization. It was NOT. Your company physically removed that money from my bank account which I absolutely did not authorize you to do. Your customer service reps are rude, spoke over me and yes, I was angry, however, putting me on hold and not coming back is unacceptable. If one of them would have just listened to what I said, I may have been more successful in explaining my issue. The ""authorization"" does not need to be ""dropped"", I require a REFUND back into my bank account of the money, and I want that money returned immediately. This is the worst experience I have ever had booking a trip. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! I have no trip and they have $919.40 of my money!",36,25-54,F

"My son is going backpacking in the Bob Marshall wilderness area in Montana and he asked my help in getting him some protein bars for his trip.  I googled Clif Builder Bars and found supplementwarehouse.com.  Once I went on the website,  I saw that the pricing was fantastic (much cheaper than other sites for the same product), the ordering process was easy and straight-forward.  I just ordered today, but I believe that I will see the same level of service in the delivery of my order -- I'm sure that I will.",61,55-64,F

"Ive booked a number of hotels with Agoda. When it works well - in other words, no need for trouble shooting or customer service - its a good deal. When it does not work well - when there is problem that requires support - it is awful. One problem I had recently is I booked a hotel in Europe. It was unclear from my confirmation email that, in fact, the booking went through Booking.com and that I should contact Booking.com for troubleshooting support. It was also unclear in the confirmation email that the payment would me made a the hotel. I was unable to get through to customer service - apparently my Agoda booking ID had been erased in the system. I got through the system using another Agoda booking ID and then spent 30 minutes on the phone talking to customer service sorting it out, and asking them to make some simple revisions to the confirmation email so that, to customers, it was perfectly clear what implications of bookings passed to sister agencies would be. The response was lukewarm. Another issue I had was checking into a hotel in South Africa and the hotel had to record of my paid reservation. They did not want to accept my voucher and proof of purchase. They said that the voucher did not state the amount paid for the room. That was very awkward.",44,25-54,F

"After carefully looking for a white ceramic Rado watch for my wife, this website had the absolute lowest price. I went ahead and ordered the watch, however it was out of stock at the time I ordered it. I received an email right away asking me if I still wanted to order it. i said yes. I was tolt it might take 6-8 weeks to get from the manufacturer but for me to contact them at any time for an update of which I did. I always received a fast response. It took about 6 weeks to get but it was worth the wait. It came in a factory sealed box and was in prestine condition. I contacted my salesperson Bobby to tell him how pleased i was with the watch. I have NO reservation in recommending this company for the next purchase of your timepiece. Dr. S. Goldstein",59,55-64,M
"I've bought and sold items on the eBay auction web site for years, and still keep coming back to participate in the best world-wide yard sale going, thanks to the fun shopping incentives eBay keeps coming up with, and the ease by which I can find pretty much anything I'm looking for, no matter how out-of-date or otherwise unavailable it might be. A current shopping incentive on eBay is eBay Bucks, which is a small percentage of each purchase which can be accrued over a period of time (weeks or months) and later put toward future purchases. Some items recently have appeared as discounted on eBay as further incentive. Once shoppers have tried and gained experience with what's involved with making purchases at auction, buying and selling become fun activities. I've spent many a rainy day searching for and finding things I wouldn't be able to find anywhere else, and I've enjoyed selling things to appreciative buyers so I know my old stuff has found fabulous new homes.",49,25-54,F
"I've shopped at amazon.com for more than a decade now, and seen this web site rise up from a simple place to purchase books to one of the most reliable places to order just about anything. Amazon's customer service is so fabulous that if I can find the same thing available through amazon or somewhere else, I've often made the choice to purchase on amazon, thanks to its exceptionally reasonable return policies, and the fact that just about anything amazon ships is perfectly packaged and speedily shipped. Amazon now sells some items which are shipped through ""third parties,"" and the same level of consistency in quality packaging, speedy shipping and items being as advertised may not always apply to such third parties. I especially love amazon's product reviews, and it's links to show what other customers often eventually purchase after viewing a particular item, and I love the way amazon makes it easy to quickly find and read both glowing and critical reviews, to ferret out the real scoop on a particular item. Reviews are voted upon, so more detailed and fair-minded reviews are easy to find, and shoppers can fast become well-educated on just about anything and everything. Amazon is also great for internet window shopping!",49,25-54,F
"While I've purchased the exact same products at another web site, I came back to imedmart because it clearly has the best prices, along with super-fast shipping and excellent packaging.

Other companies lure shoppers in with temporary discounts, while imedmart strives to maintain an overall reputation of consistent excellence in all respects of the consumer experience. I look forward to ordering from them again!",49,25-54,F

"I had been searching for a particular model of Haier 15' wine cooler. Sam's had offered the item for about $450 including shipping, but they no longer stocked the cooler I was looking for. I found the same item on other sites for up to twice Sam's price. I found the same item for about the same price as Sam's, but also with free shipping on ShopBLT.com. After reviewing customer reviews including some negative ones I had some misgivings, but decided to take a chance and I'm glad that I did. Fedex delivered my cooler to Savannah from a warehouse in California in only 3 or 4 days and it was in perfect condition.",65,65+,M

"Up until recently I have been a Amazon Prime fanboy, but I have been burnt twice by it. So it started simple enough good idea, free two day shipping, however movies kind of sucks, they have less than Netflix, but all in all love it for buying my computer parts that I cannot get for less than I get from a company discount(monitors, printers, etc). My fiancé decided to sign up for the Mom account, this is a quick setup, but what wasn't clear is that this will cancel my prime account. So my prime account was canceled, oh well just get it fixed, so the credited me the difference in shipping cost to my prime account cost. So I called to get this error fixed, and the customer service rep, credited my account the shipping account so I would pay for Prime - credit, which would be fine. This is where the second problem was, so they charged my account the full Prime account cost, so one person set it up wrong? So they decided to credit my account and cancel it, not the best move to get repeat customers. So with that said Amazon 5 stars Prime 3 stars, maybe Prime should model themselves off of Amazon being such a great service! Maybe if they fix this I would recommend them, but not now.",27,25-54,F

I was quoted $62.50 by Textbookrush.com to buy back my brand new algebra textbook that I paid $199.50 for. I verified the ISBN number from the book and the packing slip from the company where I had purchased it from. I had dropped my online algebra class and couldn't use it on campus. They have received this brand new never used textbook and claim a different ISBN number was on the book and are only sending me a check for $23.75. Thought their quote was too good to be true. What a bunch of crooks! Beware when selling them your textbooks because from what I'm reading this is a common practice with them. Scammers,57,55-64,F

"I found PetFlow through an ad on Facebook, and it was through an ad for LED collars. My dogs are both darker colors, and they love night walks, so I got excited. Bright collars are perfect for them, because we live in a busy area, and it isn't very brightly lit. The collars were such good prices- $7.99 no matter what size- and shipping was only $4.95 for the ENTIRE order! So, of course I ordered!! I ordered them on a Sunday morning, and they shipped out on Monday. I had them by the end of the week, and these collars are exactly as PetFlow described. I will be ordering from them again, especially if they keep stocking these collars! My dogs are known to be a little rough'n'tough, so I imagine I'll have to replace them soon. Their prices on the dog food are lower than in stores, too. I just wish they carried what my dogs eat.",21,15-24,F

"I have never dealt with any other company as professional and as pleasent as Melrose Jewelers. I was very satisfied with a Rolex watch I ordered from them online as a gift. I also saved thousands of dollars buying through Melrose Jewelers. Almost every watch I looked at had a discount of $1000+. When I called with some questions prior to my purchase the staff was very pleasant and helpful. They even helped me to personally choose a watch for my friend. Feeling confident about my purchase, I placed my order through a very easy process. I was pleasantly surprised at how fast my order arrived in the mail.",21,15-24,F
I have ordered several T-Shirts from this company and have been very satisfied with everyone of them. The ordering process is simple. You know right up front what the sales goal is and can check daily on the progress via the link they send you. If the preset goal isn't met (which you hope doesn't happen) then you won't be billed and your order is canceled. It really is a win-win deal.,58,55-64,F

"Even though I live in NYC, I've been trying to figure out a style that matches my personality, skin tone, etc. I've finally decided to give online shopping a try and stumbled upon YesStyle. It was not only love at first sight but I continued falling in love even further as I discovered the ""sets"" and how well the entire attire went together and could be bought cheaper than if purchased separately. Watching Korean dramas moreover makes me biased as I love the styles of the characters, but still - I'm dying of excitement as I wait for my order! ^^",22,15-24,F

I used to get frustrated when I saw large items on ebay and missed out to collection problems.  When I saw a dining table and 6 chairs just a few miles away I had to have and then found Shiply through Google.     I put in my request complete with the ebay item number and within hours started receiving quotes.   I picked my quote and within 3 days had my item.   What a great idea and I will definitely be using them again.  Takes all the hassle of having to obtain quotes yourself by approaching individual companies.      I would definitely recommend using Shiply.,49,25-54,F

The website made it really easy to see who had paid what, as well as generally manage the booking in a really straightforward and easy way. The apartments were extremely plush, much bigger than we expected and right in the middle of the city. As part of the booking we had a dirty dancing class in the day and naked butlers in the evening, all the staff were punctual, friendly and up for a laugh and made our weekend amazing! I couldn't fault hen heaven, they were always friendly and professional and feel it was excellent value for money, would definitely recommend!",30,25-54,F

"Trying to source some tyres for my car on a Sunday wasn't proving very fruitful so as a last attempt I tapped into Google and Grippy came up. I was able to order four new tyres for my car and was contacted immediately as I had entered incorrect tyre information (oops!) The order was amended and the difference refunded quickly. The price beat other quotes by a long way, despite the fact I was purchasing Bridgestone tyres and other quotes were for lesser known brands. The  mobile fitting was so convenient for me and the service was very friendly. Would certainly, and already have, recommended to friends and family and will definitely use these guys again. Thanks Guys! :)",26,25-54,F
"I had what started out as a really bad experience with this company recently.  I had ordered 2 new phones and was going to switch providers and keep my old cell phone numbers (this is called ""porting"").  My phone number was ported before I actually received my new phones though, leaving me without service for several days.  I knew I was going to be out of town and I wasn't concerned with getting my phones quickly and had planned to activate them when I got back in town so I didn't choose a fast shipping option.  But your old service gets cut off when they port your number and even though my new provider had me all set up, I had not received my new phones yet.  Therefore I could not use my old phone and had no phone service.  I called customer service to try and resolve this situation and had a bad experience with that as well.  The guy kept telling me that I chose the wrong shipping option when the problem was really that my number was ported before I received the phone and activated it. I'm not sure if this was a fluke or what.  However, I was contacted within 24 hours of placing a complaint by a manager and the COO and they apologized and next day aired me my phones and 2 free accessories.  I still had to go without a phone for 5 days BUT they really stepped up to correct the situation!  And I felt like they were really concerned about resolving everything so that I was happy.  So, at the end of the day, even though I didn't have the best experience in the beginning, they did work hard to resolve it and make it right.",37,25-54,F

We had an Alice in Wonderland themed party this year and it was a hit.  My husband and I are both plus sized and were thrilled you carried our sizes...although we would like to see more men's costumes in 4x and 5 x. My Queen of Hearts costume was great except the sleeves on my 3x costume were more like a size 12. Luckily I have a friend who could alter it. The wigs were great except the Mad Hatter wig WAS NOT the wig in the picture. It was an inferior knock off. He didn't even wear it because it was more like an orange afro. All in all it was a good experience and a great party. We have used your company before and will definitely use it again.,52,25-54,F

"I have made two purchases from Wool Overs now, 2 x long tunics in Merino/Cashmere and a long V Cardigan in Cotton/Silk. I am amazed at how lovely each item is. They are a lovely fine weight, but lovely and warm (the tunics). The cardy is perfect for mild days, as well as wearing over the tunics for more warmth. Each garment washes well and comes up softer every time. I am so happy I have found Wool Overs. I have yet to find anything comparable here in Australia. Postage is prompt; from order to Adelaide in 10 days. The company's communication is excellent. The sizing guides are accurate. I absolutely love what I have bought and will buy again as well as recommend to others.",45,25-54,F

"A young lady named ""Ryan"" made my experience extremely pleasant. She was kind, and understanding of my situation--I have a 5 year old and his car seat wouldn't fit in the back of the economy car I'd selected on line not realizing how ""economical"" it truly was. She made getting an upgrade a breeze, didn't kill w/my wallet w/upgrade charges although it was extra, and she didn't give me attitude for ordering something I actually didn't want offline. The others in the office were typical cold car salesman (or so they seemed, lol). Just there to basically do their job, might I also mention they were men soooo maybe that was the issue. They were very stoic and just tried to get me in get me out--their job I guess. But I prefer a person w/personality, that speaks to me and possibly even smiles (is that too much to ask? ).  Oh! and there was this one gentleman that was a jack hole each time I called or went to the location but ohhh well. Overall I probably wouldn't use them again because it's too far out of my way but Ryan was a total sweetheart.",23,15-24,F

However, I did not get a confirmation email or even a pick up email. I called the store later in the day to find out about the order and I was put on hold for 25 minutes. When I got to the store it was nothing but issues and annoyances. In  the end I got the items at a really great deal (half the price of Amazon which is saying something) so I guess it wasn't a total loss. However, I have done site to store with several other stores and never had this many issues.",23,15-24,F

"I have been smoking e cigarettes for about a year and a half ago. The first ones I tried I got in a gas station. They weren't that great, but I forced myself to because I hated the smell of the smoke. Then I found V2. The taste on these is much better and does not leave a weird after taste like some of them. I love that there are different flavor options as I was always a fan of Djarum Cherry before they quit making them in America. They smoke smoothly and I love that I don't have to go outside when it is cold to get my nicotine fix. I would definitely recommend it to others looking for a good quality e cig.",23,15-24,F

"My husband and I recently took a trip to Africa which we planned solely through Private Expeditions.  They were extremely helpful and knowledgeable in the planning and tailor made the trip as our needs and interests dictated.  They were always there to answer questions (and I had many!) and made suggestions to make our trip more enjoyable.  In Tanzania they usually run their Private Kilimanjaro climbs however my husband cannot manage the altitude associated with the climb so we thought we would plan a safari and a trip to Zanzibar with them which are usually add on to the climb.  These were certainly not in the ""add on"" category for they were stellar trips in themselves.  Our safari was amazing!  Our lodging, the food, the extremely wonderful and knowledgeable guide, the itinerary, the variation, the animals, the scenery, the PEOPLE....excellent!  Prior to our trip I had some hesitation as to what we might experience considering all of the warnings from our State Department (we are from the US).  I would return in a heart beat and feel this was one of the most awesome trips I have taken mainly due to the input and planning from Private Expeditions.  Our time in Zanzibar seemed like a Paradise.  We had also wanted to experience the Mountain Gorillas in Rwanda while in Africa.  This is not a trip that Private Expeditions usually schedules yet they knew of a company they thought highly of and were able to schedule our very exciting and ""up close and personal"" experience to see the Gorillas. I have read several reviews from others concerning Private Expeditions and most of these have to do with the climbing aspect of Kilimanjaro. Don't overlook Private Expeditions safaris in Tanzania as well as trips to Zanzibar--these in themselves are excellent (!!!) trips in themselves.  I found the pricing to be very manageable however on reflection, we received so much more for our money than we thought we would.  There were many a time when we would enter a lodge or room and do an ""Oh my gosh"" moment as to the wonderful quality of accommodations, food, and care we were receiving. We are considering a trip to South America in the near future and are overjoyed to see that Private Expeditions is now running trips to Machu Pichu.  We plan, without hesitation, to go through Private Expeditions.  After the planning stages, you feel as if the staff at Private Expeditions are your closest friends for they certainly took special care of my husband and myself way beyond the usual parameters of a travel planner. Don't hesitate to use them for any of their trips--you will be amazed and pleased.",63,55-64,M

I ordered a cocktail dress from MashiMaros and it is gorgeous. The sticthing and components of the dress are very high quality and had I still planned to get married on the beach I would have worn this dress. it looks similar to the vivienne westwood short gold label wedding dress. The dress is heavy bridal satin with boning in the bodice. That satin is very similar to a mari gourlay formal dress I own. It arrived in just under 4 weeks which is half the time it takes to get custom made apparel through alfred angelo or any other bridal company. I am going to get my bridesmaids dresses done through them. There are a few small things about the dress I don't like such as the side seam of the bodice does not meet with the seam of the skirt however is not noticable as the skirt is puffy and gathered. All in all I would say the dress is faaaar better than expected and I hope the next dresses I order will be of the same quality.,25,25-54,F

I was laid up on my couch recovering from a lengthy surgery and certainly couldn't cook a meal much less drive it over to the next town. So I got online and found GiftCards.com.  I was so excited!

"I ordered a branded eyeglasses. I read the product desciption clearly that it comes with an original case (and I do value an original blue case), but it did not. The on-line customer service was prompt, and she told me that all clearance items may be due to open box sale, customer returns , ""missing cases"" and closeouts. In that case, they should put ""missing case"" instead of ""This item comes with an original case, cloth and certificate of authenticity where appropriate."" She said I can return it but I have to pay 20% restocking fee and shipping cost. I regret buying it but I have concern on the returning cost. My advise to you: do ask more before you order Competitive price and fast delivery though.",39,25-54,F

"I found the glasses that I wanted on Optics Fast for a lower price than anywhere else on the web. They were glasses that were only being sold in Europe at the time so I was excited to get them in the US. I ordered them 3-day delivery mid-december and two weeks later I still did not receive my glasses, I called them several times and I was put on hold then hung up on. They finally told me that the warehouse did not have them in yet and they would have them in by the end of the week. This process continued to happen, four more times, I would get hung up on, then call back and they would tell me the warehouse would have them in by the end of the week. Finally when I called, was hung up on, called back and left an angry voicemail, and called a third time to speak to someone directly to voice my anger to, did they look into what the problem was. Whenever I spoke to someone on the phone they were very courteous and polite, however Optics Fast's shipping and customer service policy's are clearly not well developed.",22,15-24,F

"UPDATE (5/13/14): Oh my gosh! Less than 24 hours after my initial review, I must say that I am truly impressed with how this was handled by DriveTime! While it was not my intention to throw anyone under the bus, I am now driving the car I went in yesterday to buy. And all because DriveTime has phenomenal customer service that exceeded all of my expectations. My issue was immediately resolved and I was asked to come back into the store, which I did. Within a short few hours, everything was resolved and everyone - especially me - was happy. Thank you so much for taking my disappointment seriously. If every company had employees on staff as considerate and customer-minded as DriveTime, this world would be a much happier place. Thanks to Brandon, Michael and JP for making this happen for me. INITIAL COMPLAINT (5/12/14): I was ready to buy a car off the lot, had been approved for the financing, test drove the car I wanted, and then received the Buy Option from the Sales Manager. There were almost $4,000 in extra charges, that I was informed were ""optional,"" yet due to meeting certain quotas, the Sales Manager refused to take them off the quote. Not only did they lose a sale today. They also lost someone who is a huge advocate for promoting quality businesses in the Pensacola area. And I am also someone who will make sure others don't make the same mistakes I did.",50,25-54,F

"I placed an order for an unlock my iPhone on November 9th. At the time, Keys2Iphone's site said my order would be completed in 1-3 days. On the fourth day (November 13), I sent them an email asking for an update.  There was no response. I had ordered the unlocking for an international trip the last week of November-- and I ordered with this company based on the good reviews online, along with their presented window. Unfortunately, my trip came and went without any change in my order status. On December 16th, I sent another email. No response. About that time, I started checking out their Facebook page and noticed that I wasn't the only person having problems. There were lots of posts asking for status updates, complaining about no contact, and requesting refunds. Many of them were deleted within a few hours. On Dec 19th, I sent Keys2iPhone a message on Facebook and posted on their wall, asking if they had any type of update. My message was read, but not responded to. My wall post was deleted. I then followed up with another email, which was never responded to. Today, January third, I once again posted on their wall asking for an update, but I don't anticipate I'll get any response.  I see they are replying to some posters here, so maybe this will get me the customer service response I've been trying to get for almost two months. Here's the thing: sometime in October, ATT borked the whole unlocking system by changing their protocol. I get that. I'm totally understanding of that. In fact, because I knew that fact sometime around the end of November, I made sure to be extra understanding in my dealings with Keys2Iphone. Given the situation, I didn't expect an instantaneous unlock or anything-- in fact, I understood that there were delays beyond even their control. That's totally fine. What's not ok is not responding to repeated requests for updates-- even if your update is just that you're not sure of a time frame. Six attempts at contact and literally no response. I will say that in monitoring their Facebook page, I noticed that they are deleting a lot of bad posts from unhappy customers. In addition to that, they've responded to a few people with an excessive amount of glib and snark (just my opinion of course)-- basically telling them that if they are unhappy with waiting, they can get a refund, but they'll make sure the phone will be stuck locked forever. I don't get that last part, because if you haven't even started an order, why would you do that? Threats and bullying in the face of customers just wanting *some* answer is not exactly good business practice. I'm sure this post is going to get me blacklisted, too, but I assure you that even now, I'd be happy if they just apologized for the lack of communication and said we could move forward (with better communication, of course). I'm sympathetic to them getting shafted by a phone company, but you've got to keep in contact with your customers.",28,25-54,F

Make sure to look over anything you're planning to buy very thoroughly, I've bought a few things that have been defective, only to notice after tags were cut. The store is very cramped and crowded, it's hard to find anything. They're lucky not many people can afford a quality product these days.

I sent them the following message and never heard back: ""I just received my shipment.  I am a little confused in that your website specification for the SATCO S2808 indicates the initial lumens to be 685 yet the package they come in shows the lumens rating at 620. I purchased these in part because of the higher lumen rating.  Can you help me understand the difference?""",62,55-64,M

"I think Zappos is Awesome. The shoe suggestions are pretty accurate, fair prices, speedy delivery, and they can tell me upfront if they don't have my size. This is pretty important for me because I wear an unusual size. I was all prepared to give out five stars, but I had to ding them for that whole email/password theft thing. I had to change all of my passwords on my gmail and financial accounts because of this mess. Thank GOD I didn't put my credit card information in their system. Anyway Zappos needs to do better than this.",33,25-54,F
"Okay, I take partial responsibility for this one. I was moving money from Euros to Krona and they froze my money due to ""suspicious activities"". My activities probably did look somewhat suspicious due to a sequence of events leading up to the transfer of funds. I managed to get it unfrozen, but not without a whole lot of paper work and run around. Paypal wanted to charge 7% of the sum to transfer the fees PLUS a really awful currency exchange rate. I would have lost hundreds of Euros in fees if the transaction went though! Bottom line, don't use PayPal for currency transfers. They charge outrageous fees and have lousy exchange rates.",33,25-54,F
"I lived in Germany for over a year and took many trains during that time on the Deutsche Bahn service. I will say that the German train system is on time. I mean nearly always. Compared to the American - ""It arrives when it gets there"" mentality for public transportation, that's pretty good. Its also relatively clean and safe. I've never been harassed (other than by those pesky ticket takers) and I feel safe traveling the German rail lines traveling alone. The Germans need to quit kvetching - they don't know how good they have it. Yes, sometimes the train can be a little late and customer service can be slow and surly, but all in all its a pretty good train system.",33,25-54,F
"I don't know if I cheesed off Steve Jobs in a former life or something, but I have received the worst customer service from Apple. I want to like Apple. I really do. I even considered getting a Mac Book to replace my aging PC. But I can't bring myself to overlook the crappy customer service I have received from Apple. Case in point - I had a first generation IPod. I received an email that there was a defect in the battery and that Apple was replacing all first generation IPods. I found my IPod and contacted Apple. They said that they were sending me a box and I simply ship it back to Apple and I'd get a replacement within a few weeks. During that time, I had a few additional questions. Contacting Apple via phone was a nightmare and I spent a long time trying to get the right person. When I finally did get someone, they said that I had been included in the replacement program in error and that I should toss out the replacement box and NOT send my IPod in. WTF?!? I had wasted time and energy on this mess and all they could say was that this was a mistake on Apple's part?!? They were apologetic, but they were somewhat snarky about the whole matter. They agreed to allow me to talk to a manager for further explanation. Then they put me on hold. At the five minute on hold mark, I said, ""you know, life is short. I've wasted enough of my life on this mess"" and hung up. I tossed out the box. Despite the glowing customer service my friends have gotten from Apple, I don't really have much good to say about my experiences with them. I must admit that Apple has great design and everyone raves about the Mac, but Apple won't be getting my hard earned dollars. They had a chance to make a customer for life and they blew it.",32,25-54,F
"I really want to give Irma five stars, I really do. They are usually clean and well lit and the staff is usually very friendly. They have a great selection of affordable wines in Denmark and regularly run specials on their wine selections. The only Irma draw back is that they are a little more expensive than other Grocery stores in Denmark. But if you don't mind putting out a little more, Irma is worth the visit.",32,25-54,F
"I rented an apartment for six months in Copenhagen. During that time I was responsible for paying the energy bill for the apartment. Dong sends a bill every three months. I paid two energy bills and an 'overage' charge of 318 DKK. I thought that the account was paid in full and I was done. A week later, I received yet another bill from Dong. They were trying to charge me for an additional three months of service after I moved out! I called an got no resolution from telephone  customer service (I admit - I don't speak Danish well, they could not resolve this in English) so I paid a visit to the Dong headquarters in Gentoff Denmark (wayyyyyy outside of Copenhagen). They insisted that I owed the sum even though their records showed that this new bill was for a period of time I did not reside in the apartment! There has been no resolution with Dong and they refuse to admit that the bill was an error. I am not at all happy with this.",32,25-54,F

"Okay, when I moved to Germany I got a two year contract with Vodafone. They told me that if I left Germany permanently, I could cancel out the contract with no fees and no problem. A year later, I had to relocate to Denmark. I showed all of the paperwork that I was leaving Germany and Vodafone refused to allow me to cancel the contract! Their excuse was that I could still use the phone in Denmark (at 1.99 Euro a minute) so they couldn't cancel the contract. Then they came back and asked for 150 Euro to cancel the contract permanently! What a terrible thing for Vodafone to do to expats!",32,25-54,F
"Along with all of the other American flight carriers, Delta has gone to hell in a hand-basket in the past decade. I purchased an International ticket on Delta in April leaving in December. They changed my flight details at least four times between April and December. Now I was flying through a different city and arriving at a different time. I said, ""hey, if Delta can change my ticket without cost, so can I."" I called Delta and had them change the details of my ticket - without the usual $250 charge. Also, when I bought my ticket, they swore up and down there would be no international transaction fee. Guess what - I was hit with a $35 international transaction/currency exchange fee! I called Delta and received a $50 credit towards my next flight with them.",32,25-54,F

"I tried Worthpoints 7 day free trial because I wanted to look something up and find its value. I did not find it and went into unsubscribe the very same day I signed up because I did not want to forget and get charges. It said my cancellation went through but I noticed they were charging me every month for the past 5 months. and DOUBLE DIPPING! 2 - $9.99 charges a couple days apart each and every month since August 2010. I emailed and called and they simply refused to help me or even consider crediting me back for the charges. Do not trust them. I even googled them and they also have goantiques.com and other sites. I also found them on the BBB with a ""F"" rating with many complaints just like mine! They simply are not trustworthy so do not give them your credit card info because if you ever do cancel they mysteriously say ... ""No you did not."" and they will  not work with you to help you.",43,25-54,F

"If we could  we would give this a negative rating. Bought a Visa gift card for my mom and had it sent to her address of record.  She went to use it at her nail salon and after she left the place found out they charged her automatically 20% for a tip , she found this out because she went to her hair salon and found out there was not enough left on it to pay her hair stylist, how embarrassing. After the fact I went to their website to watch a tutorial and they tell you there if you do not want the 20% taken out to make sure to tell the business that and you will tip them yourself.  How conniving and deceiving this whole outfit is!.   Never again will we do gift cards!  They charge you a processing fee and shipping fee which  i knew about, but was ok with it because it was a gift.  And They did not use the picture we used to customize the card with, they put it on the paper the card was attached to.",54,25-54,F

"I have been using this site for quite a few years, and have found it to be consistently the most reliable on the web. I like the fact the you offer products at check out for discounted pricing or even in some cases free so that you can try them before you buy them. I always get a free shaker cup which I use every day, and it is a great cup, not some cheap piece of plastic that falls apart after one or two uses. Prices are very reasonable, however the shipping could be a little cheaper. It kind of brings the over all price of my order higher, but I do get my product in a timely fashion. You have my vote, but consider lowering your shipping prices, and maybe even offer free shipping once in a while.",55,55-64,M

"Ordered two pair of designer glasses. First pair took over 1 month, and still waiting on second with no word on when it will ship. Had been waiting for 1st pair so long, then opened box to find it packed in a cheap plastic bag inside an even cheaper looking soft vinyl case. These were YSL glasses--expensive. The site promises that glasses will come with all manufacturer's packaging. NOT TRUE. No papers, no cloth, NO CASE. I have to wonder if these are simply Chinese counterfeits. I am so disappointed with FramesDirect, I cannot begin to describe. Meanwhile, since I needed glasses, I ordered two pair from Coastal and received BOTH within one (1) week, along with cleaning cloth, lens cleaner, and ORIGINAL DESIGNER CASES. Plus, Coastal had better prices and MUCH better customer service. Go ahead and buy from FramesDirect if you want, but just be aware that it may take forever and a day, with little to no contact or customer service or information on your order, and the glasses may well not come with original packaging (as promised on the website and is de rigeur for ANY designer glasses anywhere). What a waste of money (yeah, close to $1,000). Never again.",50,25-54,F

At Christmas time, I was back again AND had a 10% coupon from them as a gift with purchase.  I ordered two Christmas gifts from the site.  They also offer a gift box, which is really cute - but not necessary as they package their jewelry in an attractive drawstring bag.  I would definitely recommend!",40,25-54,F

"While Priceline was as good or better than it's competitors price wise, I did not like the no first night cancellation. And this was no cancellation under any circumstance. And, the clause was applied even after I chose the 'flexible cancellation'. I would not use Priceline again if this clause pertains to all their bookings. And I  did ask if this policy was a part of my hotels policies, or Pricelines, and they said it was Pricelines. This was the first time I had ever used Priceline.",64,55-64,M

"My wife was browsing Facebook and she kept seeing the Veterans United ads so she contacted them at the end of April to see if it was possible for us to get a house. We had been trying for 30 years to get a house through the VA but they kept making us jump through hoops and tying us up with red tape that I just about gave up. So, we get a call back from Brian. I ask him to contact us through email as we get home late from work each night and my wife is online just about 20 hours a day with her job and such. Brian contacted her and they went through the preliminary application and then he asked us to send certain paperwork which we got together and mailed back to him in the provided overnight envelope. We found a great agent, Steve and he contacted Brian and then the whole process just flew by. We found a house within our approval limit and made an offer and counteroffer. Brian answered all our anxiety filled questions, helped us go through each step of the process and was there with moral support as well. Brian was the best loan officer we could have asked for. The end of the Month of May we were in our new home. My wife immediately sent Brian's contact information to a friend of mine from the Navy who was looking to refinance his home. I hope my friend uses it because Brian and Veterans Unitied were the greatest.",60,55-64,M

"I admit I opted for SmartBuyGlasses for 2 reasons. Firstly was the cost which was competetive, and scondly as the pair I wanted were marked on the site as available for Fast Delivery which was what I needed as I was going on holiday. I read their promises on delivery times carefully to see if it would arrive in time. Only after I paid did I get an email to say they were waiting for stock. So despite what the site had said when I ordered the Raybans that they were available for Fast Delivery, this proved to be incorrect. When I replied to their email they did offer me a different pair at a reduced price, but I did not take them up on the offer as I wanted what I had originally ordered. I did get my glasses just in time, and they are the real product and I am very happy with them. But if it is important that you get your glasses quicly, do not trust the Fast Delivery claim as it may not be accurate.",55,55-64,F
"It was so easy to create a card and a neat stamp with images I already had on my computer. Some of them weren't the highest quality, yet the final product blew me away.

My family was very concerned for my health because I could not sleep. My precious niece who is a registered nurse called and asked if I would help her to discover our ancestry. She purchased a subscription to Ancestry.com for me. What a marvelous gift!  Ancestry has helped not only me, but has connected my children, grandchildren, siblings and their families in a way that I never thought possible! All the family ""stories"" that my father and grandmother told were true! We are related to European Kings and Queens!  Our ancestors did help to start Jamestown!  We are distantly related to Johnny Cash! WOW! I feel as if I am reconnected to my loved ones who have gone on to their Heavenly home and have come to know family that I never have met. I am learning about their strength of character and how they contributed to man's history on earth. This knowledge has strengthened family bonds. My grandchildren are excited to learn their ancestry too! One of my grandsons text-ed me to ask if we were related to General Robert E. Lee and responded with ""Awesome!"" when I said yes. My oldest son calls me every Saturday to discuss family history that we have found during the week. My sister and I joined the Daughters of the American Revolution through the historical proof that we found on Ancestry.com!  I learned that I am distantly related to my two best friends!

"I decided last week that this year I wanted to dress up as a Hallowe'en fairy, and a Google search of the term lead me to the All Fancy Dress website. I've used other online costume shops in the past and this one was by far the best. I looked through the (large) selection of items on their website and found one that I thought looked amazing (Midnight Fairy). Being a savvy internet shopper I then did a price check but every other shop I saw was selling the same costume for at least £10 more, so back to All Fancy Dress I went. I then got distracted and forgot to actually place my order because I'm silly. I remembered about it the next day while I was on the train, and very easily managed to order the costume using their mobile site. I paid for the cheapest shipping option and was happy with the delivery estimate of 3 days. The next morning (!) my costume arrived - not even 24 hours later, and I live in a small town in Scotland so I'm not exactly close to the company base! The costume itself is fantastic quality, and it looks awesome. I wore it to a party at the weekend and got so many compliments on it. In conclusion - a great selection of good value costumes with efficient delivery and a highly functional website. A very happy customer - I'd definitely use this company again!",23,15-24,F

"All I can say after talking to a rep and a supervisor is WOW! And I shout it sarcastically. I went to the site because a co-worker told me that halloweencostumes.com was advertising 20% OFF ALL COSTUMES. I clicked on the site link and found the costume that I wanted. Going through the checkout process, I did not see the advertised promotion deduct from my total. After I received my receipt, I called customer service and stated my case. The rep was very polite, told me that they had a glitch on their site, put me on hold a couple of times to seek counsel and then told me that they would give me 15% off instead and that I should keep an eye on my bank statements (plural? how long will this take?!) to see the credit. She didn't tell me what the total credit would be, couldn't give me a confirmation number and said I wouldn't be getting an email or anything...and so I asked for a supervisor because it sounds a little shady. At that moment, I shouted to my co-worker to let her know that they weren't honoring the 20% off so that she wouldn't place her order and be in the unhappy state that I am in. Ruben, a supervisor got on the phone and was also very polite as he nicely told me that there wasn't much he could do. He explained to me that they were having problems with their emails giving old, expired promo codes, that their IT needed to update their site because they have gotten a lot of complaints about the advertised promotion, and that they were in the business to make money and he could not get an approval on the 20% discount because I basically didn't spend enough. He rambled something to the extent that he can't give me my costume for half off what it's worth, which is really weird, because I wasn't asking for 50%. I explained to him that I wouldn't have ordered from them if it weren't for the 20% off ad on the website, and I'm kicking myself for not buying the same costume through Party City who is also running a 20% off promotion (online and in-store with coupon). Ruben told me that they honor lowest price match from other stores, but not on percentage off promotions. I didn't ask them to match another store's promotion...I was asking them to match the one they advertised. Maybe someone was typing in the credit, maybe someone was writing it down. After hearing the blah blah blah from them, I am more upset and think they should just honor the 20%. The costume was $39.99 plus $4.99 for shipping. (Ha! He even told me that he couldn't even give me free shipping because I had to spend at least $50.) WOW!",37,25-54,F
"Instead of dealing with Thomas Cook who we found very good with other packages, our booking was taken over by Olympic Holidays. No boarding passes or transfers via email just very basic info re flights. Did not specify which terminal our departure was from Gatwick. It all worked out but not impressed.",65,65+,F
I would highly recommend this site.  Very easy to find timetables and the booking process also very easy plus very informative for stopovers etc.   The price was excellent also. The only problem was difficultly in paying because of the 3D security.  A couple of emails to Jamie solved this problem when he reset our account.,65,65+,F

"I love the product . . Special stamps. But no mention of postage rate increase in January. Zazzle, you could have sold me some 1 cent stamps to go with, or , just added them at no cost. The order came with a coupon good for a very limited time.  Why should I ever order more than 1 item if I'm going to get a better price by ordering 1 item and waiting for a coupon. I think you can devise a better system for your customers.",36,25-54,F

Apparently nobody bothers to test and certify rims in the US, but ALUTEC in Germany does, and they had just the thing: 1250 kg per wheel, designed and machined to the Sprinter 5-bolt specs. Then ... how to get them to me in Florida? Performance Alloys does the rest. Simple to get a quote, they arrange air freight, only minor rub is they arrive at a ""nearby"" international airport (one with US Customs on hand). I had mine shipped to Atlanta, since II have business there anyway. US Customs is very cooperative and simple to deal with at that site. Good experience all around.",71,65+,M

All their selections are really fashionable and can't be found in the area I live in.

"Are you sick of finding style that doesn't break your wallet, getting super excited, and then bummed out because of the realization as to why it was so cheap? Look no further, boohoo.com is going to make your heart flutter. You might even shed a tear. I know I did. Have you ever seen ""FREE SHIPPING"" in huge bold letters and felt your world brighten up a little bit? Have you ever looked a little closer to see ""On orders $50 or more"" written in tiny little baby font? Have you ever wanted to cry? Come here, listen up. If you live in the United States, boohoo offers free shipping. Do you see that period? Free shipping. Period. Only feel like spending ten bucks? Free shipping. Want to buy ten pairs of pants? Free shipping. I know, I know, this is hard to fathom, but I'm being real with you. In addition to shipping costs being something of the past, boohoo.com's clothing is cute as a newborn kitten, punk as an angst-filled 17 year old, and as durable as...well...something with great durability. We've all seen websites where the clothes look amazing in the summary, and then when the package arrives at your doorstep, the garment is miscolored or practically made of paper. I bought a simple black dress with a white collar for my prom from boohoo.com this past month. It was my first buy, it looked simple, what could go wrong? Nothing. Nothing went wrong. In fact, the dress is soft enough to sleep in. Not that I would though. I mean, I will if I have to prove a point. But just trust me. And on top of that, it came super quick. Like, quicker than the estimated delivery day. Can you imagine the hype I felt inside of me when a colorful little package showed up in my mailbox when I was expecting nothing? No, you cannot imagine. Do I really need to say more? I could say more, I really could. But my fingers are starting to get sore. Writing this is bringing back memories of highschool essays. No one wants that. In conclusion, boohoo.com is where I'll be stopping first and probably last too to do all of my online shopping from now until forever. I hope you do the same.",16,15-24,F

You will never find a better company that is so great to work with. I have never had a problem with Agoda in the last 4 years that I have been using them. I would high rate this company as #1. All of their special deals are great for the people who take the time and join the company membership and receive the insider deals. It is a plus to spend some time and really study and understand how the company operates. Everything you need is located on their web site. I never had to contact Agoda by phone or email because everything you need is at your finger tips when using their web site.

I checked in two days before they were suppose to arrive because I hadn't gotten any notification that they shipped.  They informed me that I wouldn't be able to get them - that somehow it had been delayed.  I told them to cancel the order - they said they couldn't.  I went to a local place in desperation and they said they would help me out and get them done FAST.  Two days later I picked them up and they looked awesome.  Three days later the shirts from Zazzle arrived and they were so BAD.  The embroidery image was too big and the stitching so so loose - it didn't look professional at all.  Worst I've ever seen.

"Name your own price works (usually) with hotels. I haven't tried it with flights, mostly because my time frames are pretty strict. I've only had one hotel that really was the wrong choice, and the fact that I couldn't get out of it was a bother: but it didn't matter because it turned out they were overbooked and had to get a room elsewhere for me, so it worked out. There is one problem, though, and it is not a small one. ***It would be nice to be able to specify a non-smoking room through Priceline.*** At the moment, you book the hotel and pay for it through Priceline and THEN you CONTACT THE HOTEL and make the arrangement, which isn't guaranteed (it can fall through if they're overbooked). If you forget to call ahead, the chances are you will NOT get the room you want. I like the service, I'll probably continue to use it when I need to, but it's just a hassle that I don't particularly enjoy. Other than that gripe, pretty good company.",57,55-64,M
If you are looking for an accommodation Hostelworld is the perfect page for you.,21,15-24,F
We have had a very good experience with Priceline - have had no problems with the accomodations or arrangements. From our point of view Priceline has made our lives much easier; we don't always know where we are going to be and all we have to do is pull up the website the night before and make arrangements for the next day. It's really very simple! It takes all the frustration out of trying to figure out accomodations out of a magazine or book about the area!  I love the pictures which give me an idea about what we are walking into...............haven't been let down yet!,63,55-64,F

"I purchased a name necklace from MyNameNecklace for my granddaughter for Christmas.  When it arrived in the mail I was so pleased.  My necklace looked even better in person that it did on the website.  The shipping was rapid and free!  My granddaughter loved it so much.  Her mother, my daughter, loved it so much that I purchased one for her in January.  Again, I had the same wonderful eperience with MyNameNecklace.  The shipping again was rapid and the product, when it arrived, was just exceptional.  I am very pleased with my purchases and the experience was wonderful!",65,65+,F

I would definitely recommend YesStyle to anyone looking for a great clothes at a great price.",21,15-24,F
"The yeswalker.com site is great; it's like a smaller version of yesstyle.com that only focuses on shoes and bags. I love that it's free shipping no matter how much you spend! A couple things I think should be fixed are that there should be an option to show all the measurements in inches rather than just millimeters (I keep having to convert all the measurements!). Also, if the shoes have platforms, please indicate the height of the platform on the shoe description! Some of the shoes are very cute, but I need to know the height of the platform along with the heel height. Besides these two minor fixes, yeswalker.com is a great site and I definitely recommend it!",20,15-24,F

"I saw a TV unit I really liked - it was exactly right for me. The dimensions were obviously given in the description, but there were drawers and a shelf in the unit itself. I needed to know these measurements too, to mke sure my hi-fi, DVD, etc would fit in the shelf space. So I sent an email enquiring about these more detailed measurements, and received a response within a few days. Couldn't be happier with the advice - very helpful!",33,25-54,F
"Horrible! Don't waste your time. The only thing worth rating them one star for, are the prices. Otherwise, a complete inconvenient hassle!! When i first made the purchase, the glasses i chose were ""in stock"". But then all of a sudden the next moment they were back ordered. Hmm go figure. Why do you offer glasses that are not in stock, only to receive unhappy customers and negative reviews? Its been almost a month and my glasses still haven't even been sent out yet. Yeah, well you better get on that express delivery and all I'm going to say is i better not get a pair of scratched or broken glasses. Seems to me my complaints are almost identical to everyone elses complaints. Get some better customer service. Would never recommend. After i receive my purchase, i will no longer be doing business with SBG.",22,15-24,F

"I would recommend but I would say just beware as our first driver who picked us up from Faro airport thought he was a formula one driver, he liked to drive as close as he possibly could to any other car, constantly bibbed any car that he thought was driving to slow. I got to my hotel in around 15 - 18 minutes. My return journey was so much more pleasant driver was a few minutes early also picked up another couple had a nice drive back to the airport which took around 25 minutes. Very careful driver.",38,25-54,F

For example once i received plums with fungus growing on, then today i found out tortilla bread that i ordered was already off on the day i got my delivery :D absolutely redicilous, once i ordered my one month old baby infacol, they sent me calpol from 2plus months, or once i ordered brown hair dye they sent me red instead :D , or sometimes they just leave something delivered, i have so many stories to tell... And delivery prices are absolutely mad, last time i paid 5 pound for fungus plums and gone off bread, Please people avoid asda, it might be cheap but the products you gonna be getting are awful.

I have learned to use Priceline over the years and am always amazed at the prices I get on Hotels and cars.  I sit in the lobby and listen to other travelers brag about prices they get at other sights and I think geez I paid a lot less than that.  I even have friends call me to book rooms and cars for their trips.  You have to learn the system but once you do you will be thrilled.  Using a bidding site like bidding for travel .com tells you other bids that were accepted and the star levels of hotels in different zone.  That information is invaluable.  Priceline should hold some webinars for people to teach them what I have learned.  Never pay rack rate again.,62,55-64,M
"Every time I need to find a quick getaway, Priceline is there.  I love how the iPad/iPhone app is so easily laid out - and the witty little comments (save the pinching) crack me up.  Their star rating is more realistic than the average and I appreciate its simplicity.  Good job making looking so easy!  Thanks guys!  You rock!",39,25-54,F

"After years of being a loyal customer, PayPal suddenly treated me like I was a common criminal and permanently limited my account for having ""too much activity."" Bloody hell, I run a business! I hate them so much and will never do business with them again. So, a friend recommended WePay. At first, I was leery since I had not heard of them before. But set up was easy and all seemed fine. Then when I first started billing people, they held my funds without explanation. Turns out they were waiting for info from the customers I had billed. Info requested from customers was stuff like what was the payment for, confirming email and billing address and confirming that they authorized the payment. It would have been nice to know that this was necessary, so that I could manage expectations. But since I didn't know, I was frustrated and raised hell about the payments being held up. After a few days, it seems everything got resolved and is now flowing fairly smoothly. I would have given 5 stars, but I have to admit that they have some catching up to do to match some of the bells and whistles that PayPal provides. For example, you won't get an email notification when someone makes a payment. You only get notified when the payment clears (which can take a day or two). Since I have a lot of transactions, it would also be nice to file away completed orders so I don’t have to wonder if I completed the order. It would also be nice to see a list of vendors who accept WePay payments so I can use WePay funds to pay them, thus further supporting WePay. They tell me they are working on this.  A WePay debit card would be nice so that I don't necessarily have to withdraw to a checking account in order to use the funds. They are working on something along these lines, I am told. Finally, it is not yet geared for foreign customers, as there is an issue with inputting a zip code and it causes problems for people trying to pay. Also, foreign (non-U.S.customers) cannot use their checking account. I am told that WePay is concentrating on building the U.S. market, so I suppose foreign customers have a bit of a wait before they can enjoy the full benefit of WePay. After the initial frustrations were resolved, I am generally pleased with WePay’s responsive customer service, ease of use, and the fact that the service works as advertised.   I look forward to more improvements and other goodies for the end user. Most of all, I hope they stay in business since they are a breath of fresh air after dealing with PayPal's nonsense.",53,25-54,F
"I get my premium dog kibble delivered to my home for the same price I would pay at my ""local"" supplier (actually a 35 minute drive from my home).  What's not to like?  It's funny that they use the tag line ""Never lift heavy bags again"", though.  Until they provide someone to carry the 35-pound box from my gate to my kitchen, that is meaningless.  A side benefit of delivery is the high turnover of product,which means fresher food.",62,55-64,F
"When I notified Silvertribe that my shipment (my second order with them) had gone missing between my local post office and my home, the company refused to help me resolve the issue.  In fact, a manager accused me of having received the item and lying about it!  Silvertribe ships USPS ""signature confirmation,"" and a postal employee had signed for my package (I suspect it was stolen at the post office).  Silvertribe customer service took the position that the package had been ""delivered and signed for,"" even though the signature receipt had another person's name on it and the post office's address.  I have never encountered such obstinate and unprofessional sellers online, which is saying a lot.",61,55-64,F

In all, i would definitely use this site again for any CD Key needs in the future!",29,25-54,F

"Booked flights, hotel, and taxi transfers with alpharooms and all went well.  Decided subsequently to cancel the taxi transfers and booked a car instead.  This was no problem and for safety reasons decided to take out the additional ""TOTAL DAMAGE EXCESS WAIVER"" insurance at a cost of £66 on top of the regular insurance. To my surprise when I went to collect the car in Portugal I was asked if I wanted the excess insurance.  I replied that I had the TDEW but was informed that this was irrelevent and unless I took out their excess insurance at a cost of 134euros that i would be liable for an excess of up to 6500euros!! Well that was a no brainer, so the moral of the story is forget the TOTAL DAMAGE EXCESS WAIVER insurance supplied by Alpharooms and get it at resort.  I contacted Alpharooms and unfortunately they didn't want to know.  Shame.",59,55-64,M

I liked the free trial arrangement which I think is essential if you're buying glasses on line. The prices were very competitive and I liked the fact that the cost of the extra coatings was not used as a way of inflating the end price.

All orders hve been filled correctly.",45,25-54,F
"This is a great company with a large selection of items. They almost always have what I need at some of the lowest prices. The only problem that I've had with them is their shipping - it's ridiculously slow. It's not just the shipping method that they use - it's how long they take to ship. I just placed an order today. I'm really hoping that they redeem themselves. The prices are worth it, if you're not in a bind time-wise.",39,25-54,F
I recently switched to supplementwarehouse for my supplements and protein powders. I was thrilled with their price matching service - which beat the prices of the lowest competitor that I could find.

I've just ordered from them again and will continue to do so.,39,25-54,F

When I graduated college and started my current job, I had the worst itching for a Cartier watch! Always hoping to run into a pre-used one, I gave up  after a year or so.There was no way I could ever spend 14,000 odd dollars on something for myself! Last spring I came upon Melrose Jewelers when searching online. THAT DAY, I found the exact style watch I had been wanted for over $2000.00 off! I was soooo excited and couldn't wait to get the watch in my hands!! I suppose that is why Melrose's also provides over-night Fed-Ex shipping...good call, guys!",21,15-24,F

"I really like this company because the products that they offer are of very good quality and they are almost always given with very detailed information. The only reason that I did not give this company five stars is because of the lack of communication between customer and company during the shipment process. Also, how you will order an item that will then become unavailable before they ship it, but they do remove the charges which I'm thankful for. Lastly, their packages are delivered in a reasonable manor. I've gotten really addicted to this store :))",21,15-24,F

I ordered a black shirt with a golden bird on it as well as a green halter top with floral designs. Both arrived in good condition (though they smelled strongly of something like factory chemicals) and I was happy with both. I saw nothing wrong with my order. They also seemed honest in that they did not process another shirt that I ordered when the color I wanted was not in stock and sent me several emails to notify me.,20,15-24,F

Viator followed up with emails, directions, vouchers and even a phone call the morning of our flight, to remind us that we had to get there at a certain time and gave us routing tips and traffic warnings.

"We rented a car from Orlando, Florida online through the sixt website. When we got to the shuttle area meant to take us to the Sixt office around 2 am, the phone number of the 24 Hour office they had provided on our receipt gave us an answering machine explaining that the office was now closed. We tried various other numbers that we found online until we got through to the shuttle. When we arrived at Sixt they informed us that they actually had no car for us. They had over booked and would refund our money as well and bring us back to the airport. We were informed that the pre paid rental amount would be refunded immediately, however it took multiple phone calls and days  to complete the refund. We loved the price of the rental which is why we chose the company. It was disappointing to have such a negative experience.",23,15-24,F

"We  used Suntranfers to transfer from our cruise ship to the airport. I used them in both Barcelona and in Venice. For both transfers, the drivers were on time, had a clean vehicle and were courteous. We had a group of 4 one time and a group of 6 the second time. The vehicle was large enough to carry our luggage also. Suntranfers was a much cheaper option than taking multiple taxi's and more personal (still costing less) than the transfers offered by the cruise lines. I would use them again.",51,25-54,F

"I am always skeptical of warranties, and when a friend recommended that I purchase Square Trade, I did so thinking it wouldn't be worth the investment.  Previously, when I purchased similar products from different companies, it was always like pulling teeth for service and quality.  So when my 2 yr old dropped my ipad and broke the screen last week, I was bracing myself for a very long and drawn out experience. First, I didn't have to sit on hold or press 100 different numbers on an automated system until I reached an actual real life person, I was quickly connected to a representative who briefly explained how easy it will be to file a claim, get a repair and get reimbursed.  I probably spent more time (all but 5 minutes) trying to comprehend that this process was going to be a breeze than the actual filing & approval of the claim took. My daughter broke the iPad at 3:30PM on Tuesday - my claim was submitted, approved, the ipad was fixed by a local repair shop and money was refunded to me ALL by Wednesday 3:50pm. I had a smile on my face the entire time.  Thank you SquareTrade for making such an inconvenient moment the most pleasurable, reliable and quality experience it could possibly be!",29,25-54,F

After searching and searching in my local mall and shops, I could not find any boots that could compare.

"The selection is absolutely wonderful! I adore Asian fashion and find it to be a refreshing alternative to what you can find here in the US. It's easy to spend a lot of money on this site, but I'm totally happy with what I get. Last time I ordered, everything came in perfect condition and fit me great! One thing that's especially great for me is that I have a small chest and most clothing here in America looks a little frumpy on me since it's intended for bigger busted girls, but everything from yesstyle not only fits my bust but compliments it nicely!",20,15-24,F

"11 September 2011 My Photon MicroLight~1 is reliable, economical, and compact. I had used a keychain light from a hardware\variety store but it lasted only a few times over the months I had it.  Then no light.  There was no battery to replace because it was a disposable.  The Photon MicroLight~1 worked many more times and endured over more months.   When it goes out I will be able to replace its batteries.  The expense of owning the Photon MicroLight~1 is cheaper over the long run than purchasing several hardware\variety keychain lights over the years.  It is brighter in reading menus in dark restaurants;  I do not have to move it over each word like the hardware\variety store light. Also, it is on my keychain that I don't have to carry a handheld flashlight.",70,65+,M
"My now husband purchased my engagement ring from Brilliance. I could not have been happier with my ring. It is simply gorgeous. Jonathon provided my husband with excellent advice and superior service. I also had my husband's wedding ring made with Brilliance which came out flawless. My wedding ring was also made from scratch and it turned out stunning. It was a Tiffany design without the Tiffany price but it is just as beautiful and sparkly! Jonathon and his team know EXACTLY what they are doing. I will definitely use them in the future (rather, my husband will) :) and have recommended and will recommend them to my friends and family.",28,25-54,F

They keep not sending me items that I ordered and paid for and always all they got to say is.(As for the missing item we regret to inform that we were not be able to fulfill the remainder of your order. We had attempted to special order the item from our supplier but the item is not available at this time.) Always which is bunch of b/s its funny because one of the items I didn't receive was still up for sale on the site same size and everything and the customer care person Monique said that its out of stock or whatever even thought I told them its in stock! Im so fed up with not receiving items that I paid for/always asking for the money back that they charged for them when it should be refunded automatically without me even asking and having other issues, better yet I shouldn't even have this problem. I shall not be silent no more because everyone should know what they do this. The only helpful AMI customer help has ever been the ones on facebook they always respond right away and are very nice and understanding. But other then that good luck with dealing with this crap! Nice clothes but they really need to do something about the out of stock thing when the person already bought the items and expect them. Now I have to find new items that are similar and spend shipping and handling money and time to do so.",22,15-24,F

My items were all the wrong sizes & they didn't let me know the extensions were on backorder. I waited on hold for 20 minutes all 4 times I've called. It's been 4 weeks & I still haven't received my backorder item or been refunded. 2nd order- I ordered a bathing suit 10 days ago. My order still hasn't been processed & I still haven't gotten a confimation number from UPS...this is quite interesting considering I paid the extra 2-day shipping charges near $30. I will NEVER order from this company again or recommend them to anyone. I hope you take my advice & save your money & time.

"I was skeptical about ordering from China and not being able to view the product in person. Turns out they sent me a 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich OS tablet instead of a true 4.0. This was no stated in the description as of this posting. Not a bad thing once I used both Amazon App Store and Google Play to download my apps like I have on my cell. This tablet is awesome fast on WiFi connection, long lasting battery and just right in size. Sou8nd is pretty good for such a small item. I wish it was bluetooth compatible and 3G as well. My only con would be that in order to get the crispness of the graphics, the brightness needs to be full. Not a bad thing as the battery last a long, long time. I only use it for stored games. No bloatware (unwanted apps) is the most fabulous thing about this unit. All in all customer service worked out differences and I am happy with my purchase. It is a fingerprint heavy capacitive screen. Keep a cloth nearby. CS is sending the earplugs/headphones that were supposed to be in the box. Instead I received a international plug. (Update, not receiving headphones/earplugs... many many correspondence later, still trying to resolve.)",100,65+,F

"I've rented cars many times and usually everything is OK.  This time I have to given an excellent rating to the car rental company.  Car was better than I wanted, no hassle over using my credit card insurance, and very quick both at pick up and drop off. The location of the office and car pick up couldn't have been better unless they met you at the bottom of the jet way.  If I was teaching a class on how to manage a car rental business I would use this location as the example on how to do things. The whole choosing a car, booking the car and paying for the car was also very well done using Rentalcars.  I would use them again rather than going directly to a specific rental car site.  The price was better than the one I was quoted from the company that supplied the car.",61,55-64,M

"I was searching for a treadmill and after looking at various different suppliers and reviews I came across JTX Fitness and I pleased that I did. I had to wait a couple of weeks as the machine I wanted was out of stock. But it was well worth waiting for. It was delivered the day after it was dispatched and within 10 mins of it arriving I was using It. There is nothing to assemble, just unpack from the very sturdy box and away you go. It is an extremely well made machine and I am delighted with it. I did have a few questions before I ordered the treadmill and Simon and Libby could not have been more helpfull. So if like me you are looking for a sturdy well made machine that comes with excellent customer service then go to JTX Fitness.",57,55-64,M

However, immediately after speaking with my case manager, Lauren Walsh, I was relieved after she explained in great detail the process in which I would be guided thru over the next 24 hours.  True to her word, I received a confirmation email after each step and until I received my passport.  With peace of mind, for once, I didn’t have to do the babysitting.  The steps were broken down and accompanied by extremely thorough directions.  I would not hesitate to recommend this service to anyone who needs a passport renewal within 24 hours.",43,25-54,F
From the order and each day got updates on how the shipment was coming.  All was great.  The item upon receipt was inspected and the warranty covered everything except the grommets.  I unpackaged the cover and the grommets were less than satisfactory.  Some were crushed (folded and could not run line through) others were not  placed on the cover properly (the grommets were not completely on the fabric).  This appears to be a second rate pool cover and I have to cover my pool now.  I feel those should have been inspected before shipping.  I am not willing to pay for shipping and take the chance of getting a second faulty cover.  I appreciate your updates on shipping but the quality of the product is not what I expected.  I will not order products again through this site.,54,25-54,F

All I can say is we were 100% beyond pleased with how everything went.  The boat was super clean, the staff was very nice and engaging, it had a wonderful air conditioned area and lots of nice shade to enjoy the cruise when it  got hot.  We saw LOTS of dolphins up close (which I'm sure doesn't happen every time- we got lucky) and my son and I even got to help the fisherman on board reel in a fish.

My only complaint was that the coupon code input spot was really difficult to find. I almost checked out twice for the full total before I realized I had to cancel my paypal order, go back to yesstyle, and /then/ enter the code. It's worth it for what was essentially free shipping, though (I used a $5.00 coupon).",19,15-24,F

This company have no customer service to speak of. I took up their offer of a £50 voucher but when I ordered the item couldn't use it and was debited with the full amount.So I phoned them at great expense and they said they couldn't apply the voucher but would have to call back the first vac and reorder. which meant I was debited twice. The returns pack never reached the recipient-it was a gift.Obviously they want to hold onto my money awhile longer.Im still waiting and I am telling everyone buy through Amazon not with these useless people.Their product is good but the rest of the service is ABYSMAL.I think they are stupid- firstly why not just credit me with the £50 voucher an the debited full amount.Secondly what about the expense and embarresment  of picking up one vac only to redeliver exactly the same item!BIZARRE? Thirdly suspect that nobody in the company can read and they have sent the pick up pack to the billing address not the recipient.Would NEVER recommend this company.Good old Amazon rules.

"I was hesitant to use Viagogo when I realized it was a site for ticket scalpers, but it was PayPal certified.  So, I purchased tickets for a soccer game in France as a gift for my son's first overseas trip. He really wanted to see a game in Europe. Since our time was limited, I specifically chose a game on a date I knew we'd be able to attend. I paid three times the sticker price for the tickets, but wanted to make sure we had good seats. When the tickets arrived they were for a different date and at a time when we would be on our way back to the States. I immediately notified Viagogo and have had numerous email exchanges with about the bait and switch. Because the company does not have a working phone number or direct email, it is impossible to actually have a conversation with a representative of the company. I just keep getting stock email answers back with no option for a dialogue.  At no time was I notified by either the seller or Viagogo that the date of the game had changed, Nor was the correct date for the game changed on the listing until 2 days before the game - after  I filed my complaint. By that time I was stuck with 3 useless tickets and terribly disappointed son. Its unlikely we will be overseas again anytime soon. So, when I tried to re-sell them on the site, Viagogo denied the listing because there was insufficient time. You can be sure Viagogo got a hefty cut of my losses - they take a fee from both the seller and the buyer.  I am also very surprised that PayPal endorses this company especially in light of the numerous blogs and websites with negative reviews of Viagogo. 8/3/13: Reply to Viagogo: Of course Viagogo can't control when event dates are changed. However, I purchased tickets for a specific date and the seller sent me tickets for a different date. Neither the seller nor Viagogo notified me the date changed. Nor did the Viagogo website or packing slip with the tickets indicate a change in date. Neither of you warned me or gave me the opportunity to back out of the transaction.  This is a breach of contract. If I ordered and paid for a toaster oven, and Amazon sent me an iron with a packing slip that said toaster oven, they would honorably correct the situation. I understand the seller sends tickets to Viagogo  who packs and ships them. A reputable business would ensure that the buyer was getting what they ordered or would notify the buyer if there was a substitution being sent. Viagogo's reply states they do everything they can to inform the customer of changes in events, yet they did nothing in this case.  If Viagogo truly cared about the  ""inconvenience"" it apologizes for, it would accept responsibility for sending me the wrong product and ruining my son's vacation. 18/3/13 Update: I received a phone message from Viagogo that they were looking into my situation with management. That was on 10 March. I have not heard back. I tried calling the number displayed on caller ID the company does not accept land line calls and I do not have an international plan for my cell phone. I wish the company would update me on my request. Thank you. 10/3/13 Update: I received another phone message from Viagogo that they were looking into my situation. That was over 2 weeks ago, and still no contact back. I don't believe the company is interested in customer service. I've yet to speak with an actual person.",58,55-64,F

We arrived in Madrid airport and followed the instructions to the Resort Hoppa desk for our pre-paid booking. Despite their conditions of a maximum 30 minutes delay we were told the driver would be 40 minutes so go to the cafe by the desk and he will fetch you. 45 minute later nobody arrived so we went back to the desk to be told that she was unable to contact the driver. This was now one hour after we'd arrived. On asking when the diver would arrive we were told she had no idea as she couldn't contact him.I told her therefore I had no choic ebut to take a taxi.

I wanted a white watch for the summer last may.  I found a lovely watch on the watch hut site.  It was much cheaper than other retailers.  I already have one DKNY watch so I know they are brilliant quality and couldn't quite believe how little they were asking for the watch I wanted.  So i had to have it simple as.  When it arrived I was so pleased with it that I haven't taken it off since.  I just love it.,57,55-64,F

"My last transaction about 6 months ago was horrifying with yesstyle.com.  They messed everything up and their customer service was horrendous.  This time though I had a really positive transaction, the only reason I went back to this site was because they had sent me an email saying they had a discount if you bought 4 lens's.  I then took a second chance on the company because the discount was so good.  I ended up getting a great deal and an added $5 dollars off with a coupon.  But then I accidently ordered the same order twice.  I called their customer service line multiple times and always got a recording.  I left messages but no one responded so I left them an e-mail.  Someone answered me back within 1 day and cancelled the wrong order.  The shipment came within 1 week of ordering and it was perfect.  Everything I had wanted was in there and the shipping didn't take forever so thanks! The only improvement I would say they needed was to fix their customer service.  I think with this company you kind of take your chances with them every time you order because sometimes it will turn out good and sometimes it will be a frustrating failure.",21,15-24,F
I am new to the warehouse however I am psyched!! I was about to purchase my products from the product website and decided to look for discounts first....and I am saving so much money here. You are charging me $19.99 each for a product that is $37.95 each from the mfg. and you are giving me the option of being able to try many new things at a great discount. Yeah my shipping went up by $4 with all the free stuff but I am not going to complain. There is no such thing as free shipping anyway.,62,55-64,F
"Arrived at Sea Mist Resort on Thursday, May 15, 2014, around 12:15 pm. The Front Desk personal was very friendly and efficient. I call the Front Desk two times, and both times I was greeted very professionally, and they did not mind answering my questions. A BIG PLUS WAS THE WELCOME CALL, once I checked in. I was suppose to have a ocean view room, what looked out towards another building, which was disappointing. The room was clean, which was a plus. The elevator was not the best, it almost stuck between floors. I was in one of the older buildings and they were celebrating 60 years.... The downside of my stay was the VERY POOR INTERNET SERVICE. THE WIFI WOULD CONNECT, BUT THAT IS ALL YOU COULD DO. YOU COULD NOT GET ONLINE. For that reason, I would not stay there again, but for the money, it was clean. You get what you pay for.",62,55-64,M

Three or so days later they told me tracking number will be emailed when my order was shipped. I thought ok but was still worried.... On dec 17 a email was sent to me with my tracking number and I DID receive my boots dec 22. They looked like the style of boots in the picture but WORST QUALITY EVER!!!!!

Some things are challenging and require some effort, but not more than you would think with so much detail available.

I like that the federal census pages have the lines highlighted for your household.  And I have the World membership, which told me I had Irish ancestors who came here by way of Australia and New Zealand.  It's the unexpected things that delight me.",62,55-64,M

"I'm not a big fan of ""insurance"" but I did go for the Extended warranty. I suppose if it breaks down, the warranty will be a good value.  Our Installer was patient, waiting while we tried to work out phone arrangements with our provider.  Be sure to ask if you can get any upgrades or ""freebies.""  We did and got a better deal than the off-the-shelf offerings.  A bit shocking, though, to see that the total cost over the 3 year contract will be over $1700.  Be prepared to be offered ""upgrades"" that may add 50% to your bill. But since the built in cell allows us to cancel our other phone line, the overall cost will be much less than having the separate line.",60,55-64,M

I always found it hard to find nice clothes. I always thought the lack of quality was not worth the expensive price. I have been using this site for a couple of years now and find it the best site for asian fashion. Lots of sales and isn't too pricey and also the free shipping if you spend more than $150USD. I like how they also sell cosmetics and other things. Thanks Yesstyle.,20,15-24,F
I am an International Sales Manager for a company that exports mining equipment to 59 countries. My responsibility is to visit our distributors around the equator and the Northern Hemisphere at least once a year resulting in me being out of my country for between 240 and 250 days every year. Sometimes I have to stay in places that I have never even heard of and then it is very easy to go on the HRS website that gives you details of all hotels in a specific city as well as price range. I have been doing this now for the past 10 years and have used the service quite a few times. I will definitely recommend HRS to anyone who needs hassle free hotel bookings all over the world.,59,55-64,M

"I really love all of the clothes posted on your website and how EVERY item has additional photographs. It allowed me look at the item from multiple angles, on and off the person. There were also a huge variety styles as well and I really appreciated the wide selection of clothes, it's a very thorough shopping site. The only trouble I got from the website was how I couldn't view more than 20 images per page (the button didn't work), and whenever I clicked back from an item's site it went back to page 1, making me lose the page I was on. It was also a bit unorganized because some items that I wanted to buy weren't in the section that they could be in. Ex: there were maxi skirts and legging pairings that weren't on the maxi dress page but they were on the legging/set page. If I wasn't looking for leggings I wouldn't have run across a few items that I ended up buying. Also, there were so many shoe pages that it was a huge hassle going through all of them. Perhaps if the view 100 per page button was fixed I wouldn't have had such a hard time. Other than that, I really look forward to receiving my shipments! I haven't tried on the clothes yet, but I agree with the return policy and I'm enjoying the free shipping/no tax. I find it to be very reasonable and it makes me want to come back! Especially because this website has the Asian style that I love but don't have access to. So basically: great items, great policy, so far great customer service, but could use some website touchups.",22,15-24,F

"I LOVE Yesstyle because they have so many cute stuff that's only available on their site. You can't really find stuffs similar in stores or other websites.

A lot of their items take 7-14 just to ship out so that's another bad thing but other than that, I LOVE Yesstyle!",20,15-24,F

I scheduled to rent a van for a week and when the van wasn't retruned before I showed up the staff offered an upgrade to a GMC Yukon. I mentioned I had concerns about the lower gas mileage of this vehicle vs. a van and how the middle row of seats didn't recline. They understood and offered me a 10% discount off my original rental fee to help offset the mileage issue and my concerns about the seats. I appreciated the very quick response to the situation and on handling the paperwork when I picked up and dropped off the car.,58,55-64,M

"When all was said and done, I had a replacement phone within 24 hours of filing my claim. It just seemed a little more disjointed than I would have expected. I started having a lot of technical problems with my iPhone 4s recently. I decided it was time to send it in to Squaretrade, so I submitted a claim (which was super easy online!). The first representative I spoke with said I could go out and buy whatever phone I wanted and just send in the receipt for reimbursement. I paid full price, not contract discounts, for mine, so I was looking at a $600 reimbursement check. Awesome, right?! Well, it turns out after speaking with another representative, that was not the case. I could go to the Apple store and turn in my phone for a replacement refurbished phone. Not the worse thing in the world. When I got to Apple they  pushed for me to go through the troubleshooting and repair process instead of just swapping out phones. It sounded like Squaretrade and Apple don't talk to each other, because I had to explain that I'd already done quite a bit of troubleshooting over the phone with Squaretrade.",22,15-24,F
"get your money back . We called at 3:30 PM the day before a NIGHT walking tour through Chinatown, and by my calculations, it was 27 hours before the trip, but by Viators calculations it was not.

We are now going to Los Angeles in August, and I'm not totally sure that I will book through Viator. I actually sent an email with a question about pick-up at my hotel. I received a confirmation and was told someone would get back to me. No one did.

"With so many brands and types of clothing at your leisure, you know Yesstyle is definitely worth checking out. Maybe you love the cute clothing, but aren't sure if their services are reliable. Because Yesstyle is an online retailer, items that are ready to ship will arrive within 1-2 weeks. However, if the item needs 7-14 to ship, that does not mean the item will arrive to your house by 7-14 days. It only means that it would take that long for Yesstyle to receive the item from China or South Korea or etc. Therefore, it would take another week or two to arrive at your doorstep, totaling at 2-4 weeks. Even if two of your items are ready to ship and only one needing 7-14 days of processing, your whole order will be delayed to include that item needing 7-14 days. Overall, the items are all described to its best match and it's only up to the consumers to read and trust the site. So far, I have had no problems with Yesstyle. There may have been minor flaws, like loose seams but never anything drastic. Before you hit PLACE ORDER, review your items. Make sure you are purchasing what you intend to or believe you are purchasing. Additionally, the rewards are pretty good. Now that there is a customer review system, it's easier than ever to reach 1000 Stylebucks, allowing you to receive 10% discounts on all items. As you progress and move up in Elite Club cards. You get 4 coupons of $10 off every purchase of $80 when you become a gold member, and etc. It is spelled out on the Yesstyle site. I hope this review was helpful and have fun shopping at Yesstyle!",19,15-24,F

I really like the privacy scanner – it uncovered a bunch of information on my hard drive that I had no idea was there, like my credit card info, logins to my online accounts and such. It actually made me mad that Windows would store this information without warning the user that it’s there. What if I wanted to sell my computer?

It's been just over a week since the TomTom was damaged, and I started the claim.  We received the money from Square Trade four days ago. Tomorrow UPS will deliver a new GPS from Amazon.com.",62,55-64,M

"I'd never so much as heard of this merchant before.  A web search for premium Orijen cat food, which I'd been anxious to try, found the company's price to be quite attractive.  Coupled with the free FedEx shipping, I submitted an order to Mr. Chewy. The item came faster than projected and the 15 pound bag was safely packed in an appropriately-sized box padded with paper wads.  It arrived unscathed. Guess one can't ask for anything more: good pricing, fast response, good communication with tracking number and free shipping.  On the basis of this one order, I'm very pleased.",63,55-64,M

"I initially learnt of hostelbookers after I did a random search for 'hostels' through my smart phone's application store. The layout wasn't all that groundbreaking, but it is laid out well, easy to follow and you can arrange the results, including from lowest to highest price (I'm sure I'm not the only one who does that). When I was able to access a computer or laptop during my trip, I went on hostelbookers website, which was just as well laid out and easy to use as the app. Made the process of booking quick and easy, which relieved a lot of stress when you'd arrived at a destination and hadn't booked accommodation yet! My only issue would be that it is not clear that you are only paying for a deposit. Sometimes I would arrive at the hostel to be asked to pay the full difference, when you believed you paid it online.",23,15-24,F
"I am 69, female, on fixed SS income. I have a 3 yr. old chihuahua, Lil Bit and a 14 yr. old tomcat, Smokey.  I love them-they are wonderful companions. Smokey will eat cat food and treats with gusto. Lil Bit, is finicky and I admit I probably ruined her by feeding her human snacks occasionally. Now I cannot get her to eat any dog food, dry or canned.  Luckily, I have grand-dogs I can pass her ""won't eats"" on to. I discovered PetFlow and their VERY reasonable sale of bag of dog food which I purchased to try with Lil Bit. It was a very easy, fast shopping for me and my order was here in about a week. Now to test it.  Thanks for a very helpful idea. I have already made another order.",69,65+,F

I ordered the magnets I wanted to use on my music stand and two days later theya rrived. They are just perfect! I would recommend them to anyone. The website gives you all the information you need to select the correct goods for the job. I use 4 12mm magnets for the edges of the music and a 19mm in the middle if it is very windy. It was windy today for the park job in Middleton and they worked absolutely beautifully. Other people were losing music but I was fine.,56,55-64,M

I posted a rating below as well. I just recieved my THIRD order today! I purchased 5 pairs of shoes/boots and a dress. Everything came exactly how I ordered. Took only a week to receive anything. I had emailed them 2 days after I ordered to see the status of the delivery. I emailed them at 10pm that night and before noon the next day they emailed me back with my tracking number. The email response was very professional. Maybe I am just getting lucky? I dont know.. but I am so happy with amiclubwear. I don't recommend calling them to check up on things cuz they have a very high call volume. I tried twice and both times I was like caller 45 or something lol. Email is your best bet :),22,15-24,F
"I've been in IT for over 20 years and have witnessed a trend toward flashier, very complicated web sites for customer shopping.  In my experience this had led to a very difficult shopping experience that is only getting worse as site designers try to out do each other in visual complexity. Bolt Depot's site is very straight forward and easy to use.  It was a genuine pleasure to shop there.  I had been searching on-line for two days trying to find a specific U-bolt.  I found what I needed in just a few minutes here.  Kudos to your web site designer.  Whatever you pay him, pay him more.  He deserves it.",56,55-64,M

"WHAT HAPPENED TO MY POST ON 3/13/2012??? As a 1st time buyer from PetFlow, I'm very pleased with their prices and keeping to the shipping schedule by FedEx. However, PetFlow should use a heavier grade of box or use more tape to hold the box together. One 64# carton of dry Innova food had its bottom coming apart. Also the Expiration Date on the 2 30# bags and 1 4# bar treats were just  a few months from expiration; I like the dates to be into the next year from purchase date, that way I know the food is fresh and keeps its flavor. The 4 cases of can EVO food had an Expiration date well into 2013 which was fine. But 4 cans in one case were crushed; I don't know if it came from PetFlow that way or it happened during FedEx shipping. On both boxes the tape broke going over the sides of the boxes. In any event, I will give PetFlow another chance in  several months.",101,65+,M

Some of the historical stories & pictures have absolutely blew my mind.I have been a member for well over 10 years and do not anticipate ever letting my membership lapse.

"OpticsFast pictures do not display in RGB but instead are muted and are their listings describe the product wrong in the pic, wrong in description , and wrong by advice from representatives...You will not do wrong and get by..... It is dishonest and poor Customer Care to know that the pics from vendors reflect wrong colors and descriptions thus causing people to order wrong frames and have to pay restocking fees of 20%.  20% of $ is $64 dollars plus shipping.  They will take almost $100 dollars if you buy and have to return your item..I made much effort to resolve which was in vain...OpticsFast has a deaf ear and their level of customer care is really low. Don't do business with them for you stand the risk of looking at pics that do not display true colors and descriptions that leave out colors and representatives that tell you the same thing as their pics and descriptions on the internet because they have not seen them either.  Thus this is a Lose Lose Lose situation with the customer at a 20% loss, shipping loss and time loss and abusive tactics phone calls and emails.",55,55-64,F

"I looked up one company, with whom I had what must be a common bad experience, and saw mostly 5 stars or 1 star. The 5 star reviews were often short and generic, came during a relatively short period of time following bad reviews, and the reviewer had only one review here. What would motivate those 5 star individual(s)? My question: do you screen these types of reviews, whereby a company might polish their image? If so, how? Do you look at the IP address?

Dualj charges for books upon receipt of order. Later they claim delays in finding merchandise. For 6 months now they have not returned my calls (their call center says it is under repair all the time - try it and see) or my emails. Have not received books. Difficult to contest credit charge because they lead you on until it is too late to contest at credit card company.

I checked the following day to ask them to confirm delivery, and was told they had ordered it for me from Rycote. It may just have been the computer system getting it's knickers in a twist but annoying.  Why can't all systems tell you that they have no stock?

"Ordered a 3 door wardrobe on 24th April with a delivery expectation of the following day. I received an email informing me that delivery would not be on Friday. Later a telephone call call confirmed the wardrobe would be delivered on Tuesday29th April. Later in the day I telephoned the Company and was advised it would be delivered. No delivery. Made numerous calls to the Company requesting a call back. Finally I was told that they would contact the delivery company to contact me. No communication was received. On Thursday, 1st May it finally arrived, Only it was a 2 door and a 1 door. The driver was surly. However, we did not accept the delivery as it was not as ordered. We requested our money back. We have been told delivery of the same items will be made on 2nd May and if we reject them then we will have to pay £79. The item is not as advertised and if we had known this then clearly we would not have ordered, Never again will I order from this Company. The worst thing is that they do not seem to care whether the customer is satisfied.",66,65+,F

"Several of weeks ago I stayed up late at night doing some work on my laptop. I felt a little tired so I took a break from the laptop and decided to take a nap. I left the laptop with my usb flashdrive in it on the corner of my bed...awful idea! After I took a short nap I realized that I had knocked my laptop off the bed. My laptop landed on the side with the usb flash drive in it and my usb flash drive had broken into pieces! My laptop was fine but I was really concerned about my usb flashdrive bcse I had NEVER broken it before. I also had a lot of important docs and personal info on it. I basically thought I had lost a lot of my important personal info forever! I did NOT know where to turn so I decided to research the internet. I looked through several websites and narrowed my search to several companies, however I still wasn't sure which of these companies would be the one for the job. A lot of these companies promised to do great work, but I was a little skeptical. I have a personal friend who is good with computers and has his own computer consulting business so I decided to let him assist me in making my decision. Based on all the info provided he told me in his opinion the company to go with was with eProvided. Since he knows what he's talking about and I respect his opinion I agreed with him. I then sent my damaged usb flashdrive to e-provided. When it arrived they let me know right away and then told me they would try the basic recovery process in order to fix it. That did NOT work so they gave me several options to fix it. At first the prices they mentioned I thought were outrageous, but when I took the time and looked on their website it did mention those same prices. However they decided to work with me and we found common ground and worked out a reasonable price for the repair. The communication process throughout was crystal clear for the most part and they always followed up with me throughtout every step of the repair process so we would be on the same page. If I had any questions they were very knowledgable professionals and answered all of them. I was very suprised at how quickly they recovered my data bcse I was expecting it to take much longer. I'm thankful that eProvided recovered my data and because they did I know they were the right company for the job!! If I ever have this problem again I know whom I will go to or recommend. However I hope I learned my lesson & be more careful in the future. Thank you eProvided on a job well done!

I ordered three outdoor tables and two chairs and was quoted $201 for shipping. I had to wait 4 months for the chair and they charged my credit card. I kept emailing them to see why it never arrived. I have to email them 5 times to get one answer a few days later. They told me 4 months later that I would have to pay $1000 USD for shipping and it would be shipped to the airport and not even to my home! I am not paying that much for shipping when I was never told so the price when I ordered it 4 months ago. I would not have ordered it from them. They told me they were going to refund me for the tables and chairs over a month ago and still have not received refund or my order!!!!

"I booked a 14 day rental in FLorida, prepaid entire amount and recieved a voucher good for Alamo. Went to pick up car with Family and luggage and Alamo said the voucher was only good for non US Drivers license holders!! I paid about $500 through Carhire3000, which was half the price of direct Alamo and it was only good for non US?? But when they took my money they knew from my Credit card info that my address was US! I paid Alamo about 1200$ for the 14 day rental because I was stuck and it was a holiday period. SO I call carhire3000 and they say because I DID NOT PICK UP THE CAR and because I did not cancel within 3 days, I would be charged 3 days  fee whcih they calculated to be $100! I only paid $500 for 14 days and they werre charging me $100!! They told me the Terms and COnditions, which ran over 100 small print words, required me to be non US license holder. I could not find it in the Terms and COnditions before I booked, but did find it in the voucher. SO what? Why didnt they put in in big letters so I could read it??

I ended up spending a lot more than I wanted, but got such great deals, that it was well worth it. After my girlfriend tried a few things on, we had to return some things, and customer service was excellent. With easy returns, and good customer service, I decided to place yet another order and once again was greeted with good assistance, fast delivery and low prices. Out of all the shops out there that are for women, this is definitely a highlight. I found the experience to be easy and simple.

After several e-mails back and forth, they informed me that they do not sell this part and do not have a way to special order it.

I am going to dispute this charge with my credit card company since partsgeek has left me no choice.

The passport came in exactly as he said it would and I was able to jet off to Europe for a very important week. If it had not been for James and RushMyPassport.com, I might not be employed today.

First time I used the site –I live in England. I was after a pair of Wiley X sunglasses – ordered while on holiday abroad. Noticed no phone numbers and thought they were UK Company. Had a query email from them after the order was accepted asking for more details for security purposes – possible because I was ordering whist abroad on holiday? Noticed then that it was a Hong Kong company and got a little worried - although my order was for over £100 and I used a credit card - so I was financialy safe. Couple of more email exchanges and within 10 days I was watching the tracking details on the courier web site - sunglasses arrived as ordered. Very satisfied although looking at some of the reviews on here - some people are concerned at lack of email response. Guess if the company reviewed their admin and answered emails more quickly they would have less negative reviews. Hope they get this sorted (they did send me an email asking me to give my opinions as they had some poor reviews with a 5% discount on my next order) I can't fault them as I got what I ordered at a good price within the time promised. Date of review - 25th April 2013,61,55-64,M
"Ancestry.com is very easy to use, plus they have all of the U.S.A. census records up to 1940, and Social Security death records up to just a few years ago. They also have Birth Records for most of the states They also have lots other records like City Directory information and church records Draft and service records for WWI, WW2, The Revolutionary War and the war of 1812. They have more that I cant think of right now. Emigration records and ship passenger records are also available. If I can do this, anybody can. The only advise I can think to give right now is to check and double check the information to make sure you are looking at the right person. It can be deceiving if you don't have enough information.",63,55-64,M

"I have been a long time member of Ancestry.com and have decided to probably not renew when my membership is complete.  Customer service is non-existent.  What happened to e-mail customer service?  I find it difficult to call during the hours you have customer service representatives available.  Shouldn't you be making it convenient for me to contact customer service?  I made my tree private months ago, but people are still saving items from my tree.  How are they doing that?  Also, information about living people is showing up even though I specifically have them designated as living.

I contacted them by the way of a premium rate telephone call and was told the order had been cancelled as the parts were not in stock. When asked when they would return my payment I was told in a couple of days time. It appears that they only return your payments after some undetermined timeframe at their will. They use your money on cancelled orders to bankroll their organisation, I guess it is the only way they can make a profit.",57,55-64,M

"I ordered struts for my vehicle using their website using only the part numbers they said woudl fit my vehicle.  There were two possibilities both of which looked similar and both of which were said to fit my vehicle.  I would have called, or 'chatted' to verify this but that was impossible.  The first problem was that after I put in my order I was advised immediately that they could not ship the parts to my mechanic without my calling my credit card company and adding an alternate shipping address and then emailing partsgeek with a number they could use to verify this.  That added a day to the process.  After a week the parts still had not arrived but I could not call or email partsgeek to find out why, I had to open a trouble ticket on their website and was advised it woudl take 24 to 48 hours for them to respond.  Their response was to give me a tracking ticket number advising me the part had arrved, but the location was in another state and the weight on the package was too low to be mine.  I had to open another trouble ticket.  After several days the confusion was cleared up and they shipped the part to my mechanic.  On arrival, it was not the correct part for my vehicle.  That too could have been cleared up with a phone call or a 'chat session' or even just an email exchanbe but... I had to go back to their webiste and open yet another trouble ticket and wait another 24 to 48 hours for their response, then respond to it and... no and on.  The bottom line is that after a full month I was finally able to return the wrong part to them, which ran me $35 for the shipping.  I ordered the correct part from another supplier mainly because I needed it NOW and I was able to talk to somebody and give them the vin number of my vehicle to make sure it would be the right part.  I got the part in four days and it was right.  I did finally get a credit from partsgeek and it did not take the 'thirty days' they indicatede it might.  I will give them that. The bottom line for me is that some form of more direct communication needs to be availablle to avoid confuiison in the first place, and if there is a problem to clear it up without days and days of back and forth communication via their 'trouble tickede' system and the absolute impossibility of communicating with them any other way. The experience was stressful and left me with the same frustration one gets when all one can do is read the 'canned' messages, all of which read as very 'defensive' - like being read one's rights by a cop and hope there will be some reasonablenes at some point. The fact that I was able to order my parts from anoher supplier online and actually paid less for them, and they were the right part, and it only took four days from order to installation speeks poorly for the partsgeek system?",71,65+,M

"I usually use another site for some of my dogs' food but I was looking for a certain food and their price was (what I thought) rather high. So, I searched for a better price and found PetFlow so I ordered there.",57,55-64,F
I have been looking for a food for a puppy that is beyond finicky! This puppy dog food is top of the line. They got it to me on time and the box was in great shape! Packaging was over and above get!

"I had been hosting successfully for about 18 months with airbnb...i even hosted one of the founders Nathan without knowing at the time.  About 3 weeks ago, I stopped being notified in my email of instant bookings.  I had to go online to see my calendar and almost overlooked bookings that used to be automatically sent to me.  I hadn't changed anything.  I contacted airbnb and it took a couple of support people to figure out and fix, but after that I stopped getting contacted altogether.  Two people contacted me privately through my own website (which refers guests to book using airbnb), to say that they wanted to stay but airbnb said my listing had been removed.  No one informed me that my listing was removed.  I left several support emails to airbnb last night after a former guest contacted me to say she tried to book again but my listing was removed.  Then I texted with live ""chat"" and Andre F. told me he's get right on it.  8 hours later another potential guest called me to say they wanted to come this weekend but airbnb showed that my listing was removed.  This time I phoned airbnb emergency support and was told the same thing.  They would try to figure out why my listing wasn't showing up -- not even to them.  He said he would raise it up in the level of importance but still, I have not heard back from them and my site is not showing up.  If they removed it, they should tell me first, and tell me why?  I have had over 100 positive reviews and often tell potential guests who find me through other sources to please use airbnb to book, but now I'll reconsider.  This is my business, and I'm angry that they have not helped me with this issue.",62,55-64,M

I ordered a part aver a week ago and got the normal confirmation. Since then I haven't heard a thing although I was promised an email when the part was shipped. I would have expected to have heard by now if there was going to be a delay beyond the 1-2 business days the web says it takes to ship the part. I am disappointed in the service. I've already received parts from other orders from other vendors placed several days after this one. Not sure why I'm not being kept in-the-loop on my order. I will probable look elsewhere for parts next time.,58,55-64,M

I have bought 3 mats from Mats4u. Two of these are for my football club. The first was the standard out door mat for an entrance. Everyone likes the look of it and it is easy to clean.

Movavi programs are excellent low cost choices for the video and audio tasks that the average consumer might need to perform.

"I had previously ordered 2 shower towers (2 years ago and 6 months ago) from H/R with no issue. We are renovating a condominum we recently bought in Florida and ordered 2 units to be shipped to the contractor onsite in Florida. The package arrived and H/R shipped the wrong unit, so they screwed up half of the order. We had scheduled a plumber to hook both of these up so that had to be rescheduled and we were charged a rescheduling charge. When I went to customer service online, they wanted a complete description of what they had shipped. Luckily the contractor had taken a picture of the 2 units and then H/R agreed to ship out a replacement. I had now spent almost 2 hours online. When the replacement order arrived via email, I noticed that they were shipping the replacement to our address in New Jersey and I immediately contacted ""Sadie"" back at customer service who assured me, twice, that this is the way it had to be entered, but they were absolutely shipping the replacement to Florida. 4 days later, the replacement arrived at our New Jersey address. Sadie again promised to get back with a forwarding label and information about shipping. It has now been 4 days and I have heard nothing from H/R. On my own and at my expense, I have shipped the replacement to our contractor in Florida (having opened the package to make sure A: it was the right unit, and B: all the parts were there. I've now sent another email requesting a refund of my shipping charges and some offset for the massive screw-ups. Bottom line, if you have all the time in the world and don't mind sending things back, several times, then order from Hudson Reed, otherwise beware. I've recommended them to several folks, but now must go back and warn them. For this renovation, we have ordered a lot of items online --another company omitted part of their order but when I contacted them, I got a courteous reply after an apology and the missing faucet was sent overnight, again with their apology. January 28. H/R sent yet another shower tower to the address in Florida, with no prior notice to me. I continue to get apologies and insistence that they are doing everything in their power and referring the matter to their managers. Meanwhile, I now have 2 shower towers, the original wrong one and one extra one. I was promised that someone would contact me about pick up instructions prior to today...guess what, no email or phone calls. It seems my only option is to have the contractor put the stuff on the curb and be done with it. I cannot believe the supreme incompetence.",67,65+,M

While the choice of food is not dictated by money, once I have selected and my dogs agree on a food, then getting it at the best deal possible is of great importance.  I found one retailer who really offers great prices about 9 miles away from me.  I live in LA so 9 miles to us tends to be more dramatic an undertaking than 9 miles in many other locations.   The kibble I buy is the same price as Petflow and the case of cans is cheaper by $5.  BUT factor in that there is no sales tax (about 10%) and the pleasure of not driving the 9 miles -- what a deal!! Shipment was immediate and fast.  And I like ""free""!",55,55-64,M

"Our tour guide, Maria, was very knowledgeable of the area, extremely professional and accommodating. I was a bit concerned about the drive through the mountains, but our driver, Mauro, navigated the coastline and tiny streets with such ease and expertise which allowed me to concentrate on the breathtaking beauty of the coast. Maria & Maurio were punctual at our pick up spot in Naples. We were driven to Sorrento having time to take  breath taking photos along the way. In Sorrento, we were given a quick tour and were taken to a Limoncello factory for tasting and purchasing. We also had free time to walk through the market. Our next spot was Positano.  We stopped to take pictures and we walked all the way to the beach. Last, but not least, we went to Amalfi.  On the way there Maria gave us the choice of either having lunch in Amalfi or a restaurant that was on the way there. When we saw the views, we chose the restaurant. Once in Amalfi, we had a little time to shop in their markets and have some pastries. Maria and Mauro returned us to Naples safe and sound. I strongly recommend this tour to anyone considering this excursion, it is worth every penny. If you get Maria and Mauro, you will truly have a great time.",109,65+,F

"Ken Altman, Expedited Travel's Escalation Supervisor, along with Terry Price and Sabrina Meyers, were incredibly helpful in a difficult situation.  I lost my passport in a home move, filed through them, then found my passport, but it had been cancelled, so had to get through State Department maze to get my passport in time to leave for Italy. THEY DID IT !  In addition I did not know that my old passport was expiring in November which is NOT 3 months after my travel date.  If I hadn't gone to rushmypassport.com and found Ken, Terry and Sabrina, I would have gone to the airport and been told ""sorry you can't go to Italy on this passport.""  GREAT resource.",70,65+,F

Away for the last four days without a coat, yes I know a stupid thing to do in May, but my Mac in a Sac has been brilliant.

You need to join Ancestry.com if you want to search your ancestry. You can get so many documents that you would have to travel long distances to courthouses & libraries & look on microfilm. I would suggest ordering the latest version of Family Tree Maker & synchronizing it with your online tree. When you change or add something on one it shows up on the other. Also have your wordpad pinned to your task bar for copying & pasting information that isn't copyrighted. This is the only site I use. New information is being added every day!!,72,65+,F
"I have been researching my family tree for over 40 years and Ancestry.com is by far the most comprehensive, user friendly tool I have had the pleasure to use. I find the affordable monthly membership fee a bargain! They roam the world collecting precious records of all types that would otherwise be out of reach of most of us. We have a place to share stories and photographs that enlarge our knowledge and understanding of  our ancestor's lives, not just their vital statistics.Someday I hope to visit the countries and hometowns of many of my progenators, until then, I sit at my desk and it comes to me.",63,55-64,F

"Husband and I used James Villas for the first time May 2013.  We wanted an early season break in Menorca as we both love the island.  Our attraction to James Villas was the many choices of area and also the car hire included was a big factor for us.  We stayed just outside Cala n Bosch which has a beautiful marina and lots of bars and eateries.  We stayed at Villa Malva and we were so impressed with the accommodation.  It was clean, up to date furnishings, fantastic patio and pool and very private.  Although we did not require the services of the Representative, she popped round to introduce herself and to check that we were happy with everything which I thought was a ""nice touch"".  All in all even though the weather was some what unpredictable, we had a lovely, and more importantly relaxing week.  Thank you James Villas we will be back.",57,55-64,F

Given how rapidly the internet environment changes it is important to have good support in dealing with challenges as they arise.  The experience with InMotion support has been far superior to other hosting companies we have dealt with.  Their level of technical expertise is high and issues are promptly resolved.

"DE 241448 was delivered while recipient was on a 2 week vacation! I explicitly asked that recipient be contacted by phone prior to delivery. When recipient returned home, the flowers were dead. A neighbor had found them outside recipients door, most likely after several days laying on the floor, she did put them in water, however, recipient was not home. The Florist, if it is a respectable one, should have left a card requesting the recipient to pick them up, or waiting until they could reach her. Very bad Customer Relation.I was just informed of this when the recipient returned from vacation. Immediately I wrote customer service and so far no reply! So far, 2 star De 241448 to 2 separate Recipients were highly satisfactory, both were surprised, happy with flowers and chocolates. this one is a 5 star! Depending how the first issue is resolved, I will hold off with other orders. this issue was resolved, recipient received a new bouquet of flowers with a sincre Apology! Great Job, I am now very satisfied! Thank you, Euroflorist! BTW< wrong date above, this is September, not June!",65,65+,F
"I purchased a solar cover for a customer and when I opened it and put it on the pool surface it was a mile out of square. The customer was not happy and I was not happy, but I could not possibly fold it back up and return it... after several hours of trimming and fitting it is on the pool....out of square looking but functional.. I lost my profit on the job to make the customer semi-happy.. two days latter the customer called and said the protective cover that was included with the solar cover was 4' feet short...sure enough it was the wrong size... Talking to customer service, they told me that the 24 foot x 40 inch protective cover was just a sample and I could purchase the right size cover for the solar cover....WTF are they talking about....I have purchased dozens of solar covers and they all come with the white plastic cover.... They did offer to replace the solar cover if I sent them a sample which I did, but have not heard back.....never again",66,65+,M
"From day one the guys steered me through everything I needed, stuck by me when I was my most obstinate, and cheered me up when I was sure things weren't going well. From our first contact, all through the sale and the closing, they were invaluable. Even now, we just received a housewarming package from their group. I can't give them enough kudos for their patience, understanding, and willingness to overlook my own doubts about some points. I really have to say, they really know their stuff. A heartfelt 'THANK YOU' from my wife and myself.",77,65+,M
Have been with BV since 2010 and have not had any problems.  However I am a small investor. The handling fee is more than reasonable.  I am an investor not a trader so I am not aware of problems others my be experiencing. I recommend Bullion Vault to anyone who wants to invest in gold or silver.  Buying gold in this form rather than gold coins seems safer than storing coins at your local bank.,75,65+,F

"When I arrived at the Hertz rental location in Glasgow U.K. I was given the very best of service by the staff on hand, I asked them if it would be possible to get a diesel engine, and they said ""of course this is no problem"".  The car in question was a Ford Mondeo, but to my complete surprise, it was an updated Mondeo, very luxurious, to say the least.  I will not hesitate to use rentalcars.com, in the future, and will most certainly recommend them to everyone i am in contact with that is looking to rent an automobile.

"I was a little hesitant booking with Skytours for the first time.   However, 3 weeks before we were due to depart on our trip my husband was admitted to hospital for bypass surgery.

So very easy to deal with and would thoroughly recommend.",65,65+,F
"The car was fine, although I was not familiar with the particular gear shift, and no one explained it when I picked it up. It was said to be a  shift car but appeared to be fluid drive - I was not aware that you changed the forward gear by twitching the knob in ""D"". When I complained the car was nicely exchanged in Perugia.  I got charged twice but  it was corrected when I pointed i it out. The line at the RR station took forever to pick up the car  and  again when I returned it  at least an hour both times, maybe more- the other rental agencies did not seem to have lines. Maybe Auto Europa is the cheapest, but  they could use more help. The staff were nice and competent. The garage entrance is so tight that I scraped my 9-passenger vehicle on the door when returning it.",79,65+,F
"I have so far bought 2 or 3 games from CDKeyHouse, and have had an easy experience with them thus far.  The biggest benefit is the cheaper prices than other digital retailers, sometimes you just cannot find cheaper, and that's a save in the wallet. When my pals are down on money and they want to play a newly released game, the first thing I usually do is check CDKeyHouse's website.  Most of the time, even my friends are surprised. Just good stuff all around.",107,65+,M

I thought I was using another site to make reservation for a hotel room. I soon as I hit enter on my room reservation and not getting any kind of response - I thought Oh Oh something is wrong. I tried to call them and none of their phone numbers would work (for the ones you could find). They took you in endless loops of not providing any information. I then called the Hotel they were suppose to be making reservations for me and found they had been full for over a week. I next called my credit card company and found out they had already charged my account for $7.89 and I have no idea why. So I cancelled my credit card then and there so they could not charge me anything else. Please stay away from them - they should be taken to court.,72,65+,M

"While the delivery time was only average, UK to Australia, the quality of the product was excellent. Unlike many products from US and UK retailers, which were in fact produced in China, the Large+ size proved to be just that. In point of fact, I could have utilized a Large size in lieu. However, my purchased polo necked sweater, has proved to be excellent in all respects, and I would recomend this company, which I am sure to utilize  many times again.",82,65+,M
"I'm Amber Douglas a 13 yr 5month old Queensland Heeler.  I have always liked to herd rocks, basketballs.  I had slowed down till my mom and dad started giving me OMH hip and joint baked biscuits last may.  Now I'm back at it, just not for as long a time as before in my younger years.  My mom tells me you're only as old as you  think (feel) and I feel great.  My human friends have loved me for years and think I'm pretty smart and soo friendly. I would go on camping trips at the Yuba River, Calif. for 5 months at a time and when the same campers came up to the river they would always holler for me so we could have fun and roll rocks down in the river and I barked at them.  I still get letters from them even though we don't go there any more. Other dogs that came to the river, kind of thought I was weird but they were not herding dogs. Take my word for it, if your joints are feeling a little slow take the 'Old Mother Hubbard' baked hip and joint treats my parents give me. Thank you Amber and her Mom and Dad",73,65+,F

"It took us a while finding the pram (Orbit G2) sought for our expected little new one recently, and when we finally came across this website with a user friendly GUI , I took few steps checking their address (google street view), contact number..basically all those few questions marks that could spin in one's head when about to spend an hefty sum of money on an online purchase. Happy with what I saw and the response I had on the phone when I called at 12:00AM that Sunday (or course I didn't expect someone to answer me at the time of the night but at least to make sure the number was leading me to the named company/shop) The order was placed straight away without any hesitation as I was able to run a quick search on Facebook, Youtube to see whether they have a page/account so YEAH Eva (one of the store Managers/Owners) was there running demos of different items. Where the won my heart it's when I heard the door bell going off on that morning of Tuesday (just couple of days after placing the order) -Who's this? -We've got a delivery for you! said the DPD driver... I wasn't too sure what it was as my partner and I been shopping for baby stuff that month, and when I followed the man to the van I could see the long Orbit G2 box there in his van waiting to be taken home.... Such a good experience and rr appreciate the nice touch from Eva also calling me on the day to check if we received the parcel. Will be going back again, in store this time (the London one) to grab some washable nappies. Williams",88,65+,M
They are cheaper and fast handling service the only down is for the contact number (not a normal landline number when the need arises to get hold of CS Reps). The return could also include a prepaid stamp just in case. But overall excellent experience will certainly recommend. Williams - London,87,65+,M
"But, in reading the previous guests reviews and having driven to the Grand Canyon previously from Phoenix, we are really looking forward to being chauffeured and guided on the 2-day tour.

"When I drop $500+ for something, I expect reasonable treatment.  First, I had to wait FAR TOO LONG for the item to be shipped, no matter delivered, there was NO reason for it.  Secondly, the lack of shipping options was really ridiculous, to the point the price I was FORCED to pay to have it shipped was absurd for the item I purchased and completely unreasonable, but no one else offered the particular oven I wanted.  There should have been another option.  I love the Magic Chef oven, but next time I spend that kind of money on an appliance for my RV, I'll be sure to order from a more reasonable company. *NOTE :  In addition I received a message from the company in response to this claiming they looked into it and that they had, in fact, employed the best and most affordable options for shipping. THIS IS NOT TRUE. Not even a week prior, I had a compact dishwasher delivered for 1/3rd the price  and it, too, came from California.  It also weighed 20lbs MORE than the oven,  was a very similar square shape and was delivered in half the time.",65,65+,F
I first heard of Boost speed some years ago through the Computeractive magazine offering a free version.  I have been using it on all my computers to keep them running without problems. I would still be using the free version had it worked with Windows 8 – a horrible o/s!

It is run very efficiently, the cabin is clean and well furnished. Cabin crew are very efficient and I would trust them with my life, (which I do). I look forward to my next trip.",67,65+,M

"I was introduced to Ebuyer by my son Stuart.Apparently he uses the site on a regular basis.He is very gadget minded so,what with the daily deals,massive choice and free delivery,it is the first place he looks.If you don't believe me, ask him. Anyway,I tried this Ebuyer for myself,result! It is like he said. I have purchased items over the last  couple of years,i am not up to his buying standard,but what I have bought has given me 100% satisfaction?I have since told a number of acquaintances to have a look at this site",74,65+,M

"Having just returned from a trip to visit my family in Australia, I wanted to make personalised cards for each of them adding photographs of the special times we shared together.  I regularly use Moonpig for sending cards because I can make them extra special rather than just buying a shop bought card, these cards are the ones people actually want to keep because they are so very very special",67,65+,F
Price was right and service was smooth.  I'll use rentalcars.com again.,65,65+,M

Just joined this program but it looks to be an excellent service for a reasonable price.  Signing up already has provided me with a safer feeling about all that I do on the internet.

"I never imagined I could get an Extended-Stay-America for $40 a night!!  Through priceline, I did just that.  We stayed in Seattle at a newly-remodeled ESA, where the people were incredibly helpful, patient with multiple questions, just very nice people.  We had good coffee (as opposed to the norm), fruit, and all sorts of other things, for breakfast (for free).  Our room was set up to entertain, or at least stay in: we had a stove w/ oven, microwave, fridge, with a counter-top with enough place settings for visitors.  In fact, it's almost a mini-apartment -- for $40 a night!!  Unbelievable!! Marnie in Melbourne, FL",65,65+,F
"Prices are good in general, BUT SOME PRICES ARE HIGH. I PRICE SHOP EVERYTHING. They make a huge fortune on shipping fees. If you need your order in less than 2 weeks, use someone else. They need to hire more people. I called to check on the status of my order and was told they ""couldn't answer the call"" THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!!! I still use them, but I prefer other sources if the price is close and the shipping fees are lower or free. I can get a $5.95 shipping charge on any sized order from All Star Health. When you factor in the shipping costs, All Star Health is cheaper and gives MUCH BETTER SERVICE.",71,65+,M
"Fabulous service, arrived before I even thought  about it!!!!",67,65+,F
"Excellent service from you, the goods, the bathroom mirror and the shower holder both came and were exactly what I asked for. Would recomment the company to anyone as I truly am a 'very satisfied customer' thank you.",66,65+,F
This company took 100% interest in us as purchasers and went out of their way to make sure that we were completely satisfied. The goods came with no problem and the delivery company contacted us with confirmation of time and kept to it. All in a very satisfactory result and would recomment The Cotswold Company to you.,66,65+,F
"I purchase UK gift vouchers for my family regularly but am usually horrified by the delivery charges which can be as high as 5% of cost.  There were no charges with highstreetvouchers, however. the downside was that my sister had no idea who had sent them when the arrived!  It would have been nicer to be able to get a higher denomination rather than sending 2 or 3 for small amounts but that is a minor concern.",68,65+,F
"The web site is poor, it usually takes 4 - 5 attempts to complete an order.  The code for 10% off on another order in a set amount of time does not appear to work.  It didn't work last year either!  However, once flowers arrive, they are attractive and long lasting",68,65+,F
"Shopping on line at Nygard is great - there is a lot of variety and some really great deals.  If you live or work near their outlet stores, you can pick up your purchases and avoid shipping costs so you don't add things to your cart just to get to the ""free shipping"" level.  Once you've found your sizes, this is a  perfect way to shop without the crowds, searching racks, trying things on, etc. etc.  The clothes are great quality and they have some lovely styles.  I shop for all my regular clothes this way and also purchase a lot of birthday and Xmas gifts without the hassles of going to a mall.",68,65+,F
Did the entire transaction online. Shipping was fast. No problem at all.,67,65+,M
$4.00 doesn't seem much but when you add up all the service charges you can incur when booking a holiday you end up with thw price of a good meal!!No service charge with Agoda means extra money to spend on the good stuff,65,65+,F
"Tech was late but courteous enough to call. He was very informative. Only think that bothered me was that I had to get an equipment warranty for an extra fee. But that was the only hidden fee so it's not so bad, I think. Overall good. Haven't used it yet so can't comment on actual service.",108,65+,F
"Teen-agers, I have decided may be the hardest to buy for! Was I that picky as a teen, I ask myself? Maybe so! Regardless, my life just got a little easier in a big way! Very delighted to discover a much easier way of surprising the ones I love most, thanks to GiftCards.com!",101,65+,F
This is the second time I've used Remove the Background and I can't speak highly enough of them.  They are truly awesome!  I sent 4 images this time and requested they be completed within 24 hours (paying the extra for that service).  They were returned to me in perfect condition within about 6-7 hours ... not 24 hours as I expected.  This was on a Saturday too.  I can't recommend them enough.  They are great!,70,65+,F

We wanted some mugs printed with the logo of our local cinema group but the .jpg file we had was of low quality.

"A couple of things.  Out tickets for the Liberty Island/Ellis Island did nothing to speed us through the boarding process.  A bit misleading don't you think?  Secondly, the 9/11 Memorial no longer requires tickets/passes.  It is open to all but the material I read regarding the Tour still indicated tickets/passes would be required.  Also it would be necessary to go through 2 security screenings.  Not so, only at the Ferry were we required to pass through a Screening.  Details just a little 'Off'? Otherwise, money very well spent.  Patrick Kelly, the Tour Guide did an outstanding job and I'd repeat the Tour if I had out-of-town guests visiting NYC.",69,65+,M

"When I first entered internet, I was directed to GoDaddy for domain name. They were so helpful, they made me feel like I knew what I was doing.  At some point, I was educated with what to do in order to be successful.  I feel that their support give you confidence and that they are reliable and very knowledgeable about domain names.  They know their rules.  Go Daddy carry reasonable pricing.  I would recommend GoDaddy anytime.",66,65+,F

"I received the following email from supplementwarehouse.com after submitting an order and my credit card info: Your order is currently on hold pending your response. The price matches you submitted are considered invalid and will not be adjusted as requested. If you would like to submit alternate price matches you may do so by submitting a help desk ticket or by contacting customer service at 800-545-8012. Your current adjusted total for this order is $175.85  if you would like to submit the order at our pricing. I followed their directions in regards to the advertised price match.  My total should have been $141.09 if they honored their written price match policy. Their website claims that if a price match is denied, a written statement notifying the buyer as to why the denial was received would be provided.  Here is their statement regarding price match denials: If price matches submitted are not approved/declined: You will receive an email regarding the status of your order and reason for disapproval. Your order will be kept on file and can be reinstated with our posted prices. You may also submit a new and valid price match for the  price match team to review by emailing the help desk or calling our customer support team. As you can see from their email which denied my price match, they did not provide a reason for the denial, they make a shady statement in their email that ""The price matches you submitted are considered invalid and will not be adjusted as requested.""  The term ""considered invalid"" is not a reason for disapproval.  If the price match I provided was false, then that would be a reason.  If the company that I wanted them to match was going out of business or running a short term promotion that was cutting their regular price down, then that would be a valid reason for supplementwarehouse.com to deny the price match. I won't do business with this company and I suggest that you don't either.",100,65+,M

Will take it from there on the fly with their guidance. Thanks Travelfish and Agoda!",65,65+,F

Sorted my requirements and placed my order which luckily coincided with a 50% off campaign. Order placed, acknowledged and goods despatched only to arrive as promised and in first class condition. ALL my future requirements for magnets will be placed with First4magnets and a recommendation will be made to all my caching colleagues at our monthly meet next Tuesday (13th September). First class service from a first class company",66,65+,M

"The site is fine, easily navigated with a good array of cat food.  What I would really appreciate is a way to sample new food for my cat.  I understand this is more likely an issue with food companies but buying a case of food new to my cat is hit or miss. One case was a success, the other an abject failure.  If I'd had the option to try different flavors from the same company I'd be able to make a more informed choice on my next order. I was very pleased with the shipping cost which is considerably lower than other sites and I will likely shop here again.",65,65+,F

Will use again when this first 50 run out. Thanks.",108,65+,M
"In short they stink. My experience was after a change of plans I needed to cancel a hotel booking. Tried their website but it wouldn't let me, said I was past the cancellation time, wasn't. Next tried their 800 customer service number, it had been disconnected, no new number provided. When back to their website and found another number. Called that and it rang several minutes until I got a recorded message saying they were closed. Gave up and called my CC company when I got home and put the charge into dispute. They had another number we called and got the run around for a full 40 minutes. CC company gave them three days to fix their problem and issue a credit. The rep from the CC company was already familiar with them and has to deal frequently with problems related to this company. This company is part of Expedia and I doubt I will be using them again as well.",65,65+,M

"I have been a PC user forever... (I really mean that) ...I've seen tools come and go...from the very first tool package on the market. Nothing has ever been easier, and yet so comprehensive.  The intelligence is evident and more to the point very useful.  The recommendations are clear, and help you to decide what choices to make while cleaning up, and selecting your performance optimizations... I've only scratched the surface of what functionality is available in this very well priced utility...and I am completely certain I made a great choice to buy-in...  There are some great free tools out there, but I didn't know what I was missing util I tried this product.  The decision to buy was very easily a yes... Can't wait to put it on my wife's laptop...

"The games are great.  I do not mind that there are ads, but these ads are horrible. These ads and pop-ups cover the playing board, interrupt the play as the mouse will not work properly, and are so bright and blingy they really distract the player.  If someone in your org. would play for just a few minutes,they would see just how annoying the ads are.  Very annoying and disruptive. The ad format makes me not want to buy the products for all of their annoyance. Sorry. But, thanks, because some of these games are great!",65,65+,F

"A year ago you guys booked us on a return flight from Vancouver to New Zealand on Air Canada. and Air New Zealand for the Rugby World Cup. Our departure date coincided with the threatened start-date of a strike by Air Canada and we were scheduled to fly AC to Los Angeles to link with a ANZ flight from there to Auckland, NZ. AC could not advise us on how we might or might not be affected by the strike. To avoid any possible problems making our ANZ connection, FlightNetwork rebooked us on a direct flight on ANZ, Vancouver to Auckland at no addition cost.We arrived in NZ in time to watch a major game the very next day. FlightNetwork gave us phenomenal service and so we always recommend FlightNetwork.com to all our friends and relatives, as we do to anyone reading this rather belated thank you note. - Raymond Skett",69,65+,M

"I built my family tree on my computer program by using what I already knew, what I found on Ancestry.com, and what I found on several other research websites.  Then It was great to take the research I have already done and download it into my own Ancestry tree, where it can be viewable for my family as well as other researchers, and I can learn even more.  Now my tree program is set up to sync with the Ancestry tree, and I have been able to easily add pictures and stories.  These pictures show up on line as well as in my personal tree program.  It is so much easier than having them inn folders on my computer.",69,65+,F

"I ordered a game and heard nothing for 3 hours. Finally I got a download link and password. After a 9 hour download, it didn't work and after hours of frustration, finally got to the point where I could install the game. When I installed it, I got numerous errors. I finally got a tech to take over my pc and he did another download. After another 5 hours, I tried to reinstall it and got the same error messages. I've sent many emails and filled out forms and have not got a reply.  AND THEY DON'T ANSWER THEIR PHONE AND THEIR LIVE ONLINE CHAT IS NEVER ONLINE.",67,65+,M
This company has a very user friendly website. I rang to fix a typo and to ask a couple of questions and the lass who answered was very helpful and was able to give me the answers to all my questions. When I was booking everything flowed with ease. I would certainly use again and recommend to family and friends.,67,65+,F
The site was recommended by a friend and I was very happy with the ease of use. It took the hassle out of finding the best and lowest fares to and from my destinations. Before this I was very confused.  This site actually gave me good details of each flight and the actual arrival times which were confusing me because of crossing the date line.,67,65+,F
I have learned a great deal about my family history and will continue to use Ancestry to continue my journey through my families past.  Still so much to learn.,68,65+,F

"I was looking for a pair of riser bars for my MTB.  The present bars were Easton Monkey Bar Low Risers.  I wanted to keep the same brand to match the other components on the bike.  I ""googled around"" and found that Merlin offered the best deal on price and delivery.  The bars arrived quickly and are just what I wanted. I fitted them to the bike and the slightly higher riding position is just what I wanted (old bones and dodgy knees).  For information the MTB is a Cube LTD Race 2012 model with a 2013 frame and I'm very pleased with it. Ray H",66,65+,M

I haven't used this company before, but should the need arise I shan't hesitate to use them again. Ray - S.E Kent",65,65+,M
"Had seen an Eames Organic chair made by Vitra in Harrods for c £1,200.  Very comfortable and just what I wanted but not at that price!   Had heard of reproductions and found Interior Addict's on line at 1/5th of the price.   There were others online (some cheaper still) but few had showrooms.  Could not believe that such good value versions could be anything like the quality so went to the showroom.  Staff could not have been more helpful.  Chair was as good as original; indeed better in some ways - a much greater choice of covers and colours.  The owner of the business explained the ordering process - made and quality control in China, though to delivery.  Would send email at each stage with update.  Not just sales talk - it was exactly like that.  When chair arrived by courier about 10 weeks later it was just as ordered in very secure packaging. Delighted with chair and all aspects of the service - cannot fault it - would definitely go back and recommend others to visit the showroom, close to Aldgate East underground station in London.   This business deserves to succeed.",66,65+,M
Your complete cooperation in helping find a job is AWESOME !!,70,65+,F
"Couldn't find 2nd floor pickup area.  Most vehicle rentals are on ground floor in most airports.  No one would go down and check the car for dents, etc.  They told me to, ""Knock yourself out."" when I asked them to go down.  I found the car with many dents, etc. and had a woman go down and mark these since I didn't want to be accused of doing the damages.  Drop off, there was no one there.  Had to use a machine.  Got no receipt except on my bank statement.  I was glad the pickup was in the airport, the car ran okay, and the price was okay.  Would probably use again, but not because it was outstanding service.  Just was in San Diego, Calif the month before and I will admit, Hertz was much nicer, but not at the airport.  I don't need gushy, but it was nice out there.",69,65+,F
I have used Supplement Warehouse for several years now. They have the products I want and need and at fair prices. Without these supplements I couldn't breathe. Thanks for being there for us.,68,65+,F
"This company is tops in my book when you take into account their knowledge of setting up legal structures, their professionalism, their patience, their friendliness, and their customer service.  This was true of all the professionals I've dealt with.  All 5-stars in my opinion.  I have not worked with a company that is as accommodating and willing to hold your hand through the intricate processes required to set up corporations.  They have a full suite of services at your disposal and what is so pleasing and reassuring is their unwillingness to pressure you into using them - they recognize that a happy and satisfied customer will probably come back for other services in time.  To me this is a sign of a mature company who is confident in its abilities.  Taking advantage of their staff's knowledge and expertise has allowed me to jump start my business without having to stumble through the process.  I would strongly recommend NCH to anyone looking to start a business!",104,65+,M

The storm was predicted  -i was running low on dog food------i saw your web page and ordered on line---Saturday before the storm hit NJ I was absolutely stunned to  see Fedex coming to the door with my order on Tuesday noontime The products were carefully wrapped in sturdy boxes and my pets have been  well -fed during this very stressful time My location was fortunate -but much devastation  all around--i could not be more pleased with your service from the ease in ordering to the delivery it has been awesome Many thanks,88,65+,F

"Responded to a request by a Rescue group I support to give Mr.Chewy a try. In return for my order Mr.C would donate $20 to the Rescue and I would get quality products for my dog. Seemed like a win / win situation!  The donation was sent to MYOFB Rescue in Ohio as soon as I completed my order online!! They were surprised, and grateful, that it worked so quickly...  I ordered enough products ($49.00) to get FREE Shipping, but the only point where I met some disappointment was not getting 15% off my first order. Well, that was partly my fault because I didn't fully understand the terms of that discount; so I sent an e-mail to Customer Service and received the nicest response almost immediately. They explained the rules for the 15% off, and gave me 10% off my order to appease my disappointment.  I can still obtain the 15% discount when submitting my next order and reading the instructions (what a concept!!!)...Delivery arrived today with everything just as ordered.  THANKS MR.CHEWY AND COMPANY :))))",74,65+,F

I had a good start with the order. The system accepted the input and I paid using the system online. I then received an email saying that there were not enough items to satisfy my order for 4 deodorant sprays. I was asked if I wanted a refund or if I wanted to wait a week. I chose the latter and expected to receive 4 items. You will be aware that I only received 2 items but the postage was the same as if 4 would have been sent so I was only refunded for the two items. Had I know this was going to happen I would have cancelled the order as the cost per item was dramatically increased by the postage charges. I would be very happy to receive a refund on the postage as in my view the goods should not have been shipped until I was made aware of the change in the number being sent. Mike Lofthouse,68,65+,M

"Great all round service.  Ordered via phone after Steve advised me on the products most suitable for us.  We also arranged with him to have our old mattress removed and taken away for disposal for what we considered a very small  additiinal cost. Afterwards we were able to obtain a two hour delivery window for the following day.  Which was very good.  The mattress was delivered  by a very pleasant and helpful young man just 30 minutes into the delivery window, first of all he removed the old mattress, then delivered, unpacked and put the new mattress in situ. We would definitely recommend this company.l",79,65+,F
Wow these bulbs are really great.  At least half the price of similiar items and they look so good too. One of the really great things about these bulbs is that they are bright within seconds.

"We contracted with Totally Driven for transport from our London hotel in Kensington to Harwich in order to board our cruise ship.  The trip was horrible. 1.	The driver was late – evidently he was parked up the street from the hotel and the hotel’s concierge noticed him sitting in his unmarked cab. 2.	During our trip through London and on the A12, he was constantly on his mobile phone (it is illegal to be on a hand’s free phone while driving in England) 3.	He put both my wife and me in danger by suddenly pulling off to the shoulder of the A12 highway, backing up for at least 200 yards and then taking the ramp to some side road.  He said that he missed the turn. 4.	 Once off the A12 he was completely lost and we had to insist that he pull over for directions. This happened three times. 5.	The only GPS he had was on his cell phone (which frequently had no signal) and because he had to look up directions on it made for an even more dangerous ride. During our cruise, we responded to a Totally Driven questionnaire regarding our experience with their service.  In a series of emails we advised them of the above experience and indicated that we felt Totally Driven was responsible, and we should receive some sort of compensation.  Their response was: Drivers and vehicles are licensed by Transport for London’s Public Carriage Office. It is on the basis of these licenses that they are recruited. They are self employed and work according to the rules and procedures that we detail, sometimes however they fail to follow those guidelines. An investigation into this order has been initiated, and the driver has been summoned to the office to explain his actions. In a sub subsequent email they offered us a £20.00 credit for future rides with their company (as if we would ever take a chance with them again!) We believe that Totally Driven is responsible for the actions of their drivers and warn fellow travelers not to deal with this irresponsible and uncaring company.",71,65+,M
"I ordered some Chicago Steak Company steaks and I have to say, I was very satisfied. The steaks were hands down the best I have ever had and even rivaled those I have had at 5 star steak restaurants. The delivery was timely and the steaks came frozen which meant I could store them in my freezer until I was ready to prepare them. The steaks were so good that I did not need to add any sauce or seasoning which I usually have to do when I order from somewhere else or just get steaks from the grocery store. I recommend eating these steaks medium rare because burning these steaks would just be a waste!   I will definitely be ordering from here again!",87,65+,M
We run a B&B in the USA - and I just received an email from 9flats that they have published our reservation calendar online and their custmers can book rooms with us.

Unfortunately, my brand/size tire was not in stock. He offered a comparable brand but I wanted the Hankook so he ordered it for me without hesitation and promised delivery by the next afternoon. Sure enough, Paul called me at 1:00pm to tell me my tire had arrived.  Installation took less than 1/2 hour and I was back in business, my old tire recycled and the spare neatly stored back in place. Can't say enough about Paul's customer service. Pleasant, efficient,  knowledgeable and professional.

I have never experienced such helpful staff as Phil, one of your Customer Services Team (I got his accent wrong but we did have a laugh about it!) who helped me to place my order and answered any questions I had very professionally. The service with your company was absolutely impeccable from start to finish. the regular updates by text and phone were also very helpful regarding delivery time. The drivers were also very efficient when they delivered my Fridge/Freezer and took the other one away.  I would highly recommend your company to everybody that I know.

I left the room to go and get a refill of coffee and when I came back, the ball was gone. Nowhere to be seen. That was four days ago and I haven't found it yet and neither have they. I've looked everywhere, but they sure hid it good! Their favorite toy is the laser pen with the little red dot. They go crazy chasing that dot! Isn't fun for me, too. I even got something for me. I got the""I Love My Cats"" bracelet. Mom has to have a ""toy"", too. Great toys, low prices, fast service-what more could you want?!",65,65+,F

"My daughter’s soon to be fiancée asked me to help him select and engagement ring for her.  After we visited a number of very reputable jewelers in our area, we became convinced that we could find an equally nice diamond without paying the very inflated prices that we were quoted.  After some on-line research and a check with the Better Business Bureau and other rating sites we found Brilliance and were very pleasantly surprised.   First, the Brilliance website is excellent.  I have some experience in website design and was impressed with both the extensive information available and ease of maneuverability of the site.  Their video is short but very informative and a must see for anyone looking for a diamond.  Second, their employees are first rate.  They give you excellent information, are willing to make informative suggestions but are not “pushy”, and their follow through makes closing the deal a breeze. Lastly, the ring Brilliance designed and made for my daughter was just spectacular and was appraised for more than twice what her fiancée paid.  I have recommended Brilliance to several friends and will continue to do so.",68,65+,F

One note of caution:  After reserving your car, call the rental company and ask them what their standard hold amount is that they place on your credit or debit card.  Mine ended up about $150 more than my overall reservation and I was unprepared.  Fortunately Dollar really worked with me but I won't take that that risk again.",67,65+,F

I was using A Taste of the Wild, but when I saw the ingredients, Fromm was an obvious upgrade for little more than the cost of the former.  Best of all, I found your website. I live in a rural area and must drive 45 miles round trip just to go shopping, and pet food takes up a lot of trunk room in my car.

I am surprised that I need to book tours overseas 6 months in advance but I suppose that's what happens when one travels in peak season. Tours looked great and after reading reviews decided to book a tour in Vancouver as we are limited to a set 3 days.

Hope the tours are as good as the website was to use. Lesley,67,65+,F

"We recently decided to put our dog Boo on Blue Buffalo food.  Since we had to travel some distance to purchase it, we opted to try mail sites instead of our unfriendly winter roads.  I am a member of FB and love PetFlow's pictures and share them all the time.  I decided to check out their site first.  I signed up for the automatic delivery for Boo on a ""wait and see"" for the scheduling. Sure enough, I received an email that my next delivery was about to go but my dog wasn't yet used to his new food so we were nowhere near ready for it!  I used their drop down box and requested a shipping delay!  It couldn't have been easier and I love this whole experience!  Highly recommend it to any pet owners!",71,65+,F

"I have booked day trips with Viator in several countries. I have never been disappointed in the quality of the tours.  My only negative is that they will not refund your payment if something happens beyond your control.

"The hanadama pearls were advertised as very thick nacre. The GIA report states the nacre is .4 mm. Every email site I read (6), stated that very thick nacre is at least .5 mm. The difference is the pearl remaining in the oyster 1 1/2 years vs 2 years. I'm hopeful they will exchange the .4mm pearls for .5mm pearls, as advertised. After speaking to a representative, my questions were satisfactorily answered. The nacre thickness, per the independent Japanese appraisal was greater than .4mm. My query was answered quickly and handled professionally. They also applied a Mother's Day discount retroactively and am supplying additional stud clasps at no charge. The earrings are gorgeous. Having unsatisfactorily dealt with Blue Nile in the past, I would strongly recommend Pearl Source. When purchasing pearls, nacre thickness and other GIA appraisal elements must be known in order to determine the actual quality of the pearls. Pearl Source appraisals allow for a knowledgeable purchase.",66,65+,M

"I started reviewing my family history back in the mid 90's and then dropped it for several years.  When I decided to start up again I did a search online and looked at several sites that I thought might help me.  After several weeks I found Ancestry.com was the best organized and was easiest to use.  Since my parents and grandparents are all deceased now I appreciated the hints that are provided and they are easy to follow to make sure you are on the right track in your research.  After a cousin I found online had her DNA done I decided to have mine done also, and I was really surprised by the results.  Not so much by where I come from, but by how many ""cousins"" I had.  A real help with the DNA results is the more people you have added to your family tree the easier it is to make the connection with your family who have also done their DNA.  It has been fun tracing my family.",69,65+,F

"Ancestry.com is the place to go to look for a family member.  I know that there are times we feel that our relatives came from another planet.  Or maybe they have never died because we can't find a death certificate. But many of the answers on Ancestry can bring you closer to the truth of their existence. However, the best way to do research for a missing family member is to set aside some dedicated time.  Get a cup of your favorite beverage.  You will need sharp pencils, lined paper, file cards and decide on one major person you want to find.  Remember to keep track of where you've been.

I expected to have this amount re-credited immediately after car return and check that no damage occurred and gas tank was full. Instead, when I returned the car I was told the amount  would be credited after few (how many?) days. Arrived in Cape Town I rented  a car  from Budget and I was asked to sign for a refundable deposit of 7000 Rand (some 700€), so my credit card was charged in total 1200€. for car rental deposit, limiting for some days my cash capability. Having problems in looking at my bank account from remote, 5 days after my 2nd car return I still don't know what was actually charged to my credit car. In may opinion car rental companies should give the opportunity to the client to know immediately at return what will be charged, to the cost of waiting an acceptable amount of time for the car check. Economy Car should give details of the return policy of the rental car companies.",65,65+,M

"When my Nook crashed and died with only weeks left on my Square Trade warranty I expected to have to jump through half a dozen hoops to get even part of my purchase price back. I was amazed when they said no problem and worried when they asked for a receipt. Out of all the thousands of receipts I've saved, this one was missing. (In the beginning of Square Trade, receipt recording was not as easy as it is today.) I was able to confirm my purchase via CC receipt and my purchase price plus a bonus for choosing an Amazon  gift card payment was in my hands in days. I just used the money to purchase a new Kindle HDX, and you better believe I took advantage of a Black Friday 30% discount to buy a Square Trade warranty for it. These guys are one of the good guys to do business with. Maryann B Tech Junkie since 1983",71,65+,F
"I loved the chance to try the frames at home and got several opinions before making a choice, it was still a difficult choice because I liked them all.  The prices are incredible, my local optician, where I was tested, had a selection of frames and the cheapest was £146, wow!!( without the lenses).   I paid £123 and got 2 pairs and one of them was transitional lenses, great quality,  brilliant! I will be back for more in the future and I have recomended the site to all my friends.",65,65+,F

"I recently purchased a McAfee package download at a bargain price. I received an activation code which wouldn't work.(This wasn't  Wowcher's fault). After reading the negative reviews I panicked and cancelled on the day I received the unworkable activation code. It did turn out there was a digit missing off the end. It was resent but no apology from the Company. (Again not  Wowcher's fault) It seems that the problem is, that you can get a refund within 7 days but after that it is a credit which can expire if not used. I placed another order at the same time but if that doesn't turn up there will be a problem with getting a refund because how long do you leave it?. Wowcher is only going to as good as the Companies they are dealing with. I think if they set there self up to be the front man and take the money they have to take some responsibility. Another thing that annoys me both with them and other companies is the premium line phone number you have to ring. I wont shop with Wowcher again because as most offers are delivered by post etc we are at the mercy of the Companies involved and the delivery services.. I think this could work very well and is a brilliant idea but some serious tweeking needs to be done..",68,65+,F

"Never ever buy a leather suite from F. V. the customer service is terrible and they refuse to answer letters . We purchased a   leather 3 seater electric recliner sofa 3 years ago which said the 5 year guarantee covered everything, but when you read the terms and conditions in the small print it excludes more or less every aspect of the sofa. It started to peel on the headrests after 2 years and got worse the more I tried to clean the area where your head rests when you recline. So I rand to complain and they sent a man to look at it and he said I can tell you now they will say its wear and tear, I said how can it wear out after 2 years . I then received a letter saying it was my fault because I had removed the coating whilst cleaning. So I rang Trading standards and they said in there opinion it had not lasted a reasonable time and was not fit for purpose and should write back by recorded delivery saying that we demanded a refund or a repair. I can tell you we got neither , they sent another upholsterer who said that whatever I had cleaned it with it would have happened even with F. V.s own Guardsman cleaner as its caused by perspiration and that they were not meant to last and suggested we repair it ourselves at our own cost and they buy a cover to protect it and take it off when we have visitors could not believe my ears,"" have you ever tried to cover a leather sofa ? they keep falling off "" I sent a further letter to say I was disgusted that they are selling leather that's not fit for purpose and that the leather was inferior as it is made in China. of course I received no reply. As we are pensioners and can't afford as suggested by Trading Standards to take the matter to court. We are now  left with a leather recliner sofa costing over a thousand pounds that looks terrible. So be warned don't buy from FURNITURE VILLAGE.  Linda Twohig.",68,65+,F

"A firm of gas central heating installers identified to me by your website proved to be incompetent and unable to do the job in compliance with the boiler manufacturer's instructions nor in compliance with various BS regulations, thereby invalidating the manufacturer's five-year guarantee on the new boiler at a stroke. This is not only my opinion but that of a Gas Safe Register (GSR) inspector who inspected the new installation at my property two days ago and also that of a senior GSR- registered heating engineer (40+ years' experience) who inspected the work done by your recommended installer approx. 4 weeks ago. The installer company also failed to detect a gas leak upon completion of their work. All these failures could have had catastrophic consequences, but for the recent intervention of the Gas Safe Register and their professional inspector! As a result of these recent inspections by qualified experts, the company identified to me by your website is being referred to Trading Standards for possible prosecution over breaches of various professional standards. My new gas central heating system, as installed at great personal cost during the summer, will also now need re-installing.

"My trip into the land of my ancestors began when I wanted to place a cemetery marker for my father who died in 1948.  All I had was a deed to a cemetery plot which turned out to be in the name of someone I had never heard of.  Through searching on Ancestry, I not only found my father but on the first day within fifteen minutes, I was connected with a woman who was a member of my family and had pictures to share.  The first one she sent was one of the few that I already had in my possession.  She had much more to share.

"As a computer 'user' rather than a computer 'expert' I have always gone into one of those large computer stores to purchase my next computer.  Consequently I have always ended up having to fit what I wanted to do to the computer's capability.  Not the best way of working! Recently I needed to upgrade my machine again, but this time I read through the advice of several computer magazines.  Computeractive, whom I have always trusted, has given several 'Best Buy' awards to some computers in the past few months.  Having shopped around several of these recommended constructors by e-mail, Web, and telephone I contacted Braebo and discussed their Ares. What a difference from previous PC shopping experiences! I was given helpful and knowledgeable advice, there are sales advisor very patiently talked through all the tasks and activities that I wanted to do with my PC, and indicated what I would need to put into the computer to achieve this. To cut a long story short, the specification absolutely fitted my needs, the price was very reasonable (compared to other manufacturers), and the service that I received was at a level much higher than I had been given by any shop assistant or sales executive. I was kept informed by e-mail on the construction of my machine, I was told when it was shipped, and it arrived the following day. What a revelation --the look of the machine is great, it's processing speed and power is more than I have ever experienced, and most importantly it has been backed up by excellent after sales care and advice. Great instruction videos as well! Would I recommend Braebo to others looking for a new computer?  I certainly would!",74,65+,M

I have used Square Trade as my warranty company for all my new electronic purchases over the past five or six years. I have had to make a few claims when one of my electronic devices failed. Without question on each occasion the product was either repaired in a timely manner or the full purchase price refunded to me within a very short period of time. My last claim was for a Asus Nexus 7 Tablet that I knocked off of my bed and the fall cracked the screen and made the tablet inoperable. I filed the claim and within a few days the whole purchase amount was deposited in my PayPal account. In no way can you beat the prompt customer service and timely resolution to any  problem that you may encounter with covered item.,68,65+,M

"Last month we replaced our old ADT security system with a new FrontPoint system.  Installation was very simple.  Activation was a breeze.  We are very happy with what we have now.  Previously we had a land line alarm.  That is so archaic today.  The alarm company did not know if the line was cut and the phone company could not tell us for sure if it was intact. A cellular system is the only way to go. We could have upgraded our ADT to a cellular system, but it would have cost way more than a new FrontPoint system.  We love being able to use the Alarm.com app to see that everything is just as we left it when we go away from home.

"In the past we have had other logos designed and it was time consuming and never produced exactly what we were after and was expensive to boot. For $99, I thought LogoMojo was worth a try. We had a telephone conversation with someone from LogoMojo, explained what was wrong with our old logo and why, and that we wanted something with a more professional appearance/tone. He asked excellent questions and seemed to understand what our non profit agency did. I still wasn't expecting to be wowed. A couple of days later, five designs arrived by email. My and staff and I liked them all; I couldn't believe it. We had fun discussing which to eliminate and why. We decided on one and asked for two changes (one at a time). Both were made precisely as directed. With the final change, it was done, and, it is perfect. I couldn't have been more pleased with the process or the end result. In addition, communication with the sales person and designer was prompt and completely professional. I highly recommend LogoMojo! Carol Martin, Director Lucas County Citizens Review Board",67,65+,F

"Photon lights are an excellent product. I used them in Iraq when light was needed, but the light needed to be unobtrusive. I have used them camping when I needed to maintain night vision. They are small and always reliable. I usually have three on my person, an IR and two turquoise. (Turquoise is my favorite for the combination of brightness and preservation of night vision. While red maintains night vision, it does not provide good 3-D perspective while moving about.) I have given them to my wife as well as all of my adult children and their spouses to keep with them at all times. I have given them to friends, including a Scorpion Finder to a regular attendee at Burning Man.

I knew quite a lot about my Mother's side of the family but have still learned more.

"Good customer service is really difficult to come by, great customer service is even more difficult and amazing customer service is practically unheard of. I can definitely say, though, that PowerMax has *amazing* customer service. I worked with Michelle to purchase a new MacBook Pro and trade in my old MacBook Pro. When I purchased my new one, there was a mix-up with UPS and they delivered my MCP to an Amazon.com distribution warehouse. Michelle worked so hard to get this resolved for me and I can't emphasize enough how great it was to know I had someone on my side helping me through this. I mean, what do you do when one of the largest shippers in the US makes a mistake and you aren't even sure you'll get to talk to an actual person? The issue got resolved and Michelle was there every step of the way. I really appreciated her work and I would definitely work with her and PowerMax in the future.",108,65+,F
"I have designed several shirts that were made by Zazzle.  The design program is easy to use, but sometimes people like me still have a learning curve.  I quickly got that behind me.  One of the things I especially like is that there are quite a few more options than another web site [CP] that makes tee shirts and coffee mugs and stuff.  Apparently Zazzle, the more recently developed program, saw the limits and overcame them.  I'd recommend Zazzle for anyone.",67,65+,F

Two weeks later the dress went on sale & I received a refund for the difference, which impressed me.  I got the dress 3 days after it was shipped.  Beautiful, and very well made.  Saved about $500.

The selection is fantastic, plants are healthy and labelled with  comprehensive  information and I've never failed to get value for money.  Their delivery service is second to non.  I bought a garden set of table and chairs and these were delivered to the far side of Reading and arrived as I arrived home.  Who could ask for better than that.  The staff are knowledgeable and always willing to go that extra mile to find a plant or item when asked.  I can't recommend them highly enough.",74,65+,F

It arrived well packed and appeared of extremely good quality and  I can't wait for my plumber to fit it.  Well done Victoria Plumb, I would certainly recommend you to others.",73,65+,F
"I haven't decided if I am a photographer who likes to write or a writer who likes to take pictures but I do know that Blurb has provided the outlet for my creativity.  I love to travel and about five years ago I discovered digital photo books as a way to document my trips.  I used several digital photo book publishing companies in the beginning but I found that none of them combined print quality and ease of layouts with the ability to add large abouts of text like Blurb does. Since I have begun using Blurb I have produced more than 15 books of our travels.  It is the best way I have found to display my photography and to archive my travel journal.  On a recent 5 week trip to France I captured over 7,000 images and wrote more than 60 pages of journaling.  I used more than 2,200 images and all of the journal in a two volume set that I just completed. When I began sharing my photo books with the writing group I belong to at a local library people were so impressed they asked me to teach them how.  I have since held six workshops attended by more than 100 people and have made presentations at organizations from art clubs to family history groups. Blurb has opened up a whole new interest for me and my plan is to try to produce at least 4 blurb books a year.  By the way, I do not charge for the workshops and at this point I am not trying to sell my books, they are just memory books for me and my family.  I do it because I enjoy it and want others to experience the same joy.",68,65+,F

"I had ordered  curtains last Spring from Light in the Box and liked them very much...nice sheer fabric, lavish to-the-floor length, well-made. So when I decided to do a much broader sweep of curtains for an even more luxurious style, I ""spoke"" on-line with someone at Light in the Box and asked if I could be assured that if I ordered additional curtains they would exactly match my earlier purchase...same fabric, same grommets, and identical length. She assured me that they would, so I went ahead and placed my order. The package arrived very quickly, and the curtains are perfect! Thank you, Light in the Box!",75,65+,F

"We met Massimo two years ago on our first visit to Cefalu when he assisted us in locating a fantastic villa. His attention to detail and his desire to please us was  exceptional. Point in fact, when we arrived and found the bed in the master-bedroom just too small for New York comfort , Massimo replaced the bed the very next day, His entire staff including the housekeepers were terrific.. He also arranged tutored Italian lessons along with an in-house personal chef, We look forward to spending several months in Cefalu this coming winter in another of Massimo's properties. In addition we have developed such a level of trust with Massimo  that we have asked him to represent us when we ultimately purchase property in the area. In summary ,we feel Massimo and the 'Italian Rentals 4 U' organization is the only company to work with. Janet & Ray - NYC, USA",71,65+,F

"My wife and I wanted to visit Sarasota overnight, and to bring our dog, We searched for hotels/motels that accepted dogs and settled on Hyatt Place, which came up when we set pet-friendly as a selection criterion. We checked all the terms & conditions and hotel policies, and the only reference to pets under hotel policies/pets was that we were limited to a small dog. We booked and paid a non refundable fare. Only when we received final confirmation - and could not cancel -  did we learn the hotel imposed a $75 charge for a dog. We were outraged and called the hotel, which confirmed this was a non-negotiable hotel policy. They advised us to take it up with Expedia. We spoke to three different people at Expedia call centres over two days to no avail. (The $75 surcharge is good even for a week, so it's not a rip-off if one stays long terms, but it's more than a 50% surcharge to the Expedia rate for a single night; even a baby as 3rd person costs only $10 more!) The $75 surcharge is mentioned under a section other than pet policies, which is not where you expect it to be. Very disappointing.",66,65+,F
"I ordered the Meow Mix Tuna with Shrimp for my Annie as that is all she will eat and the retail store I was using was always out of it  It is so convenient not to have to worry about having enough food for her and having it delivered eliminates a trip to the store and then discover they are out of her preference anyway.  I got my order less than a week after I ordered. Now, by having a supply delivered every 7 weeks, no more problems and Annie is happy!  Have already recommend this convenience to my granddaughter who recently adopted a kitten. Thank you PetFlow! M. Lestina",80,65+,F

"As you travel back in time, you'll follow your ancestors from country to country and state to state. You'll see what it was like to live back in the past. You'll encounter hardships and the best of times in a short while. You will be surprised to find that you have traveled some of the same roads as your ancestors did and find that you as they did, wind up in the same places to live. I live only a short distance from where some of my ancestors lived at one time before they traveled on to the state where I was born and lived most of my life . I was amazed to find this out as we had very little family history handed down. I have been researching my families history for over 15 years and am still finding new info about them.

"... few are using them the way I intended! I've been playing with Blurb's templates for years, even though I ended up creating my own complete pages and iuploading them. Last year I created 25 day planners. I didn't want anything too large, and basically featured Catskill-area waterfalls, using my own photographs. One side has the photo, and the other has a one-month calendar with room to write. I ordered soft cover, 24-page planners. In the past I've assembled my own calendars, but this time, I spent a bit extra, went straight to Blurb, and WOW! They are gorgeous. One dear friend, a desktop publisher, writer and editor, was thrilled with hers due being a unique, practical booklet. The quality of both my photographs and test are excellent and beautiful. They came faster than expected. I will definitely be using Blurb's services again - perhaps a coffee table book next time - or annual travel stories for my grandchildren. Thank you, Blurb, for an incredible finished product.",66,65+,F

There half day tours and even a super saver with the best of the 1/2 day tours ""sewen"" together so one can see best of the city or area. Navigating the site is straight forward.  I felt confident that I will be getting a great value for the time I have available.  For those on a more leisurely course, there are interesting excursions, day long cooking classes, wine tasting and guided tours of the local cuisines.

"Booked a tour to Hunter Valley Wineries in Australia.  Process was very quick.  Several tour options were available at different price points from reasonable to WOW - like the helicopter transpo to the wineries! Woo-hoo!  That wasn't the tour I chose.  EAch tour description was pretty complete, and easy to read so decisions could be made quickly. The tour groups seem to be small-ish, around 16 people and seem to be guaranteed to depart since I saw reviews from people where there were only 3 people on the bus. The vehicles look good, well kept, in the photos and no reviews saying there was anything shabby about the vehicles.  Check out was very quick; the e-documents clear to understand, the Reservation # easy to find.  My only suggestion to the company is that an interactive map be included to be able to make a decision as to which pick up point to book if the hotel one is staying in isn't on their pick up stop list.. All in all, a very pleasant online booking experience.",70,65+,F

"I have been a small customer for a while now and just recently have ordered more and more from Simply Suppliments... They have improved their service and most products have a buy one and get one free. They have worked well for me and have had no complaints with either there service or products, there is always explanation of every product and what its basically for. There service is very quick and easy, I have never had to wait for days to receive my orders. Thank you Simply Suppliments, keep up the good work !!! Regards, Susan Murray.",66,65+,F
"Dear Natures Best, I am very pleased with Natures Best as I have been using them for a few months now, I am slowly weaning myself off my last supplier so, slowly ordering from Natures Best !!! I am also happy that I can either call or email any of your Nutritionists any time I am not sure of a supplement or for advice about my nutritional health ... They are very friendly and helpful and will chat on a personal basis ... I feel this is very important as a lot of companies don't have this service which leaves you in the dark ... Thank you Natures Best and keep up the good quality of your products !!! Best regards, Susan Murray.",66,65+,F
"I have read many articles on the Black Strap Molasses and how healthy it is for us all not just in one way but many ways and many ailments !!! I suffered from mild backache and a few aging ailments but since taking the Black Strap Molasses I feel full of energy without the aches and pains...My nails are stronger too... I tend to sit most of the day in front of the computer as I am a writer and have to spend alot of time concentrating what I am writing about, I used to get aches by sitting in one position, but since taking the Molasses which is about a week now I find I can move around very easily, it really works. I am a very skeptical person most of the time and think to myself this is just another one of these stories how miracles work... There were too many articles out there to be ignored, I then got hold of my Nutritionist and she told me the same thing how it helps in alot of illness's ... Due to all the nutritional values in this simple natural product is why our bodies are far more healthy... I would like to thank your company for sending me a fantastic product that cost so little and so natural and can also be used all the time without having to take breaks like all the un- natural products out there. I just had a very minor problem with the jars when they arrived, it was leaking out on the sides but was totally sealed on the top, that may have been through travelling, the product was still perfectly fresh inside !!! I shall be ordering more from you in the future !!!",65,65+,F
"I placed an order with PetFlow.com and realized it was the wrong order the next morning.  It should have been for my cat, not my dog.

We were not sure if we should finance the house or pay in full?  The last two homes we owned we paid cash.  We decided to finance about two thirds of the selling price and we could not have had a better loan officer than Sam Yoo.  He  was always there for us and our agent.  We highly recommend Sam and his team to any one thinking about financing their house.  John and Mary Locke,67,65+,F

"I have been using PetFlow.com for sometime now I get regular deliveries and on only one occasion have I not been totally satisfied and that was when most of the canned food arrived in dented cans, which may well have been the carriers fault or maybe the packing was not as good as usual that time. Otherwise great service, food arrives on time, no lugging it from the store, very easy to change the order. I would unconditionally reccomend it if not for that one delivery.",68,65+,F

Received our first order from Petflow and when Fedex delivered it the box was wet and broken. I called Petflow and they replaced everything even though there probably no damage to the contents even though the dog food bag was wet. We received the replacement order promptly and the first delivery was given to a shelter. I am very happy with Petflow' service.,65,65+,F

I think one of the most important thing is what others have to say about their experience with a company. In today's online ease of shopping it is easy to taken. There are really lots of good deals to be found online. But sometimes you just need to check to see if anyone else has had a negative experience with a company before you buy. It saves a lot of grief and time to check first. Trustpilot gives you a source to purchase with confidence.,67,65+,F
"Loved the selection of quality stuff. Easy-to-use site and interface, too.",75,65+,F
"I ordered the Bully sticks and my order came quickly.  The only problem is that the sticks are about the diameter of a #2 pencil or less.  I buy the Cadet  12 inch bully sticks from Costco that are much thicker..  If I cut them in half the price comes out to be a few cents more than Petflow.  It would be helpful if the description of the product include the dimensions of the sticks.  I ordered the Bully sticks for my 6 month old Standard Poodle puppy.  Unfortunately, she will only be able to use them as tooth picks.",65,65+,F
I have received incredible service from Chewy.com. With a recent recall on dog treats all I had to do was call and they immediately credited my account. On another occasion I had ordered a 10 pound bag of dog treats which were in crumbles when I received them. Customer service immediately sent me out another bag.  They were polite and always followed through. I have not found another company that not only treated me as a valued customer but is also giving me the best deal  in town.  I highly recommend Chewy.com to everyone. Thanks! Suzanne Ypolit and Sophie,68,65+,F

"Love doing ancestry. I am always amazed how many people are related and how we all got to this point in life. Being a part of the American History and knowing all the families. who fought for this country, from the 1600s, to now it makes me very proud of who I am. Many times I have to step away from doing ancestry because I feel like I am living the lives of the people I am researching. I see how they suffered to get to America and when they got here what they endured. Just knowing how my Dad, grew to be the man he was, because of growing up in Oklahoma during the depression and drought. My mother living on the Donner Summit with her dad working for the railroad and having a job in the 1930s was rare. My mother had to get on a train to go to school because that was the only way to get out. There were no roads. Ancestry lets me see more than, my California heritage. Love it !!

I ordered two separate labels for limoncello - one batch for the limoncello  I make twice a year and the second batch for my daughter-in-law who is making her first batch this spring. The labels are very nice but I thought the price was a little high for the 10 labels plus shipping: $15.50 per batch which works out to $1.50 per label.  I don't know if I had ordered them on the same invoice if the shipping price would have been the same for all of them or not but I do know the shipping was about 1/3 of the cost. I tried to see if I could amend my first order to add the second one but it had already been processed and I was advised I would need to submit it in a separate order.,68,65+,F
"RushMyPassport.com is exceptional at providing exemplary service in an era where ""customer service"" is truly an oxymoron. They do what they say they will do and they do it well. I was going out of the country in a few days and, actually just by chance, discovered that my passport had expired. In stepped Rush My Passport to save the trip. Ken, who handled my issues, could not have been more professional, courteous or helpful. He walked me through the process every step of the way. He even followed up to ensure that everything had gone according to plan. Rush My Passport could not have been a better experience and I would highly recommend them to anyone.",65,65+,F
"A waiting professional was at our service upon arrival and departure showing a printed sign with our name on it.  They were courteous and quick, ushering us to and from our destination.

With a party of nine, sun transfers was the perfect solution to our traveling needs.  We highly recommend them.",65,65+,F

That is what I call excellent service, and they worked a treat I must add. The added bonus of course is next day delivery.",69,65+,F

But there are still ""Brick walls"" that furnish the challenge to find more about my family tree.",68,65+,F

"I am so disgusted with this company. I ordered and paid extra for an OEM part.  While they have responded by e-mail and are going to send me a return ticket, this in no way helps me.  There seems to be no way to actually speak with a live person. I still need this part but i need it to actually perform the function it was designeed for. The bag the part arrived in, does in fact picture my antenna and the toothed strap required to raise and lower the antenna... the part in the bag is a smooth cable which will not engage the teeth on the mechanism designed to raise and lower the antenna. perhaps the folks in Slovenia might actually look at the item they are placing in the bag.",69,65+,F

We don't have to worry about when the food is arriving, and don't have to go out of our way to drive to the ""correct"" store.  This is a huge help since we of course, feed our dogs and cats the very best organic and not many pet stores in our area carry those brands.  We are so happy to have PetBest as a new resource and since we are now on auto delivery we don't have to pay shipping and save more money too!!!!",69,65+,F

I appreciate that I can quickly get basic information and reviews of hostels worldwide.  Booking is easy -- good interface and safe payment system.

"Costly mistake on my part.  I trusted Expedia would help me out by finding the best option for me.  I had inadvertently scheduled my return flight for p.m. instead of a.m.  I called the day before returning home to see what could be done.  The first rep said the only a.m. flight available was at 10:30 and there would be over $1000 charge to change it.  I questioned and re-questioned the rep as I knew Delta had earlier flights to its hub, Atlanta.  He then switched me to another rep and amazingly she found a 5:45 and 6:45 flight.  The extra charge for me was now, $374.  I asked if there was anything else I could do - switch airlines, anything but she said no.  I paid the money.  Upon returning home I called Delta.  I was told I could have had a same day, stand by mode for a $50 charge, that is all. So I ended up overpaiding $324.  I made a complaint with Expedia and I am done with them.",67,65+,F

I recently was given a laptop which was fairly new and asked to replace the lcd screen. I immediately thought to check out Laptopscreen  now.  As few years ago that is where I purchased a lap top screen . The service than was excellent and it is the same today. 'I contacted them and  found the type of screen I wanted immediately than ordered it and with in a few days received it.  Took me a few hours to replace the screen as laptop was more difficult to replace a screen than most  of them.  It had screws in hard to get at places so it was simpler to remove everything to change the screen. once changed and connected up again the lap top worked great. The prices are reasonable and delivery is fast.  Would recommend this company to anyone.,80,65+,F

"On Ancestry.com, you can not only find your ancestors, you can learn where they lived, how they died, who they married and sometimes even locate a photo of them or a photo of the house they once lived in, or a newspaper article telling something about them.  You may think, ""Oh, that just sounds so dull!"", but, believe it or not, searching out your roots brings all those ancestors to life, in your mind and in your heart.  When you find a photo of your great-grandmother when she was a girl, you have to smile, thinking ""Gee, my great-grandmother was so cute!"", or you may locate a grave through Ancestry.com that has a photo of the tombstone as well as links to other relatives.  You can also find ancestors through Ancestry.com to the website that offers indexes (with photos of the actual cause of death, date, name) through the mortality schedules for each state. Ancestry.com has partnerships with other genealogical websites that are not only handy in one place, but are also free to use with the Ancestry.com subscription.  Although the annual cost is a bit high for some people, the monthly subscription to Ancestry.com lets you pay in manageable chunks without too much financial strain. Ancestry.com also offers DNA test kits and testing results for a reasonable price that will narrow down your field of searching and lets you know if you have blood from Europe, the Orient, Africa, Native American blood, etc., so you can broaden your search parameters to find missing ancestors. There is so much information packed in and available through Ancestry.com that you'll never want to log out!  You'll spend many informative and thrilling hours finding your roots!",65,65+,F

"Having purhased a single bed  I needed to transport it from London to the Midlands. I was going  to hire a van but found Shipley whilst doing an internet search into alternative options. I received five quotes within a few days of posting the 'job' and I liked the fact I could look at feedback for each driver who had responded. I found some of the feedback very negative but the fifth and final quote was very reasonable, and had excellent feedback. Due to very bad weather on the day of collection, it was a big relief not to have to drive a van up and down the M1. My driver telephoned to say he was slightly behind schedule because of fog.

Ordered a Bosch vacuum cleaner and the price was extremely competitive (£100 cheaper than usual local dealers). I was telephonde to be advised of the day of delivery but the vacuum actually arrived a dearly earlier and I was out. The paperwork did indicate the agreed delivery date. Fortunately they left it with my neighbour but I was expecting the vacuum to be opened and checked for any damage at delivery and this obviously was not done. Otherwise cannot fault the service of this supplier. Thank you,65,65+,F
Well what can I say The show was Brilliant and well worth going to watch We took out 2 granddaughter's ages 5 and 13 Got a bit loud for the 5 year old but she loves them so much she put up with it The downside was what we got conned for the price of the tickets. On the front of the tickets was the price of £34.50 but we were charged £152.50 each which I thought was the price until the tickets came in So I am very disappointed in the site for not pointing out that this was the price put by unscrupulous people who at the end of the day just wanted to make money from normal fans who wanted to see JLS. But I will not be caught again  I am 66 and still can be caught out so just be aware when you book your tickets you are not getting charged for someone's GREED,66,65+,F

"I ordered the Glucosimine tablets after meeting up with  two of my friends - they each told me  about the benefits of your products - thus I ordered the tablets on trust.

Is it pure trust - or belief or do they just damn well WORK? I look forward to ordering more of the same.  Patricia - Norfolk",76,65+,F

"I was astounded to read all the bad reviews of this company. Granted I have only ever used them twice but both times I have found the service to be excellent. My latest parcel was 5 kgs and was sent to the Isles of Scilly on Tuesday and it arrived (on one of the outer islands) by the Saturday - brilliant and it only cost £5:38. A similar parcel by Royal Mail would have cost £15:85! Most years we send a larger package, again to the Isles of Scilly weighing 15 kg,, having checked with My Hermes this will cost us £9.50 whereas via Royal Mail it would be £33. So in all honesty I can find nothing to complain about with this company. If I do experience any problems when I send our larger parcel  later this year I will post a further review.",66,65+,F

"Having read previous reviews I am surprised at the odd one that says this company is great - it certainly isn't. This is my second dealing with this store using their on-line ordering service and my fisrt experience was dreadful. This later one was actually an order my husband placed for a jacket. The item he picked up in store and no problems were encountered. However the purchase he made entitled hmi to a £10 gift card as his purchase was over £50. The gift card never arrived so he phoned them. The gift card eventaully arrived but when he went to use the offer code to reduce another item it never accepted it. He phoned them again and they said they would send another the next day,  2 days later and we still have not received it.. He phoned them yet again and they have now said it would arrive in the next 3 days as they were very busy!! Busy doing what, its a wonder they have any customers - never ever again will I use their on-line ordering.",65,65+,F
I intially contacted your customer service department as I had a aprticular query regarding a purchase. I was dealt with by a Paul Wyld who was extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble for him. I was very impressed. I then went to the Bathstore in Neston and again the lady there was very helpful. Delivery was efficeint and it arrived on the nominated day at the nominated time. I would recommend you to anyone. Thank you. Regards Helen Mack,65,65+,F
