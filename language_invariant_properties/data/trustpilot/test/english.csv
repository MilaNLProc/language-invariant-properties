"Used this site many times.  I always start mysearch here. Prices change daily and if you want to really research the price continually at many different sites, I have found cheaper cars elsewhere.  However, if you don't have a lot of time to research the price, this site has always been among the top three (e.g., cheapest) of the ten sites I use to reserve a car.",50,25-54,F

"Used Ebay for sales and purchases for the past 10 years and it has worked out for me overall. Only one issue in that time and they took care of it to my satisfaction. A good source for information and a good way to ""window shop"" when your stuck indoors on a bad weather day.",48,25-54,M

"I ordered on April 30 and finally received my order today, May 23. I understand the ""Dr Oz"" show took them by surprise, but that response is only good for the first few days, then it becomes an excuse. I understand the frustration folks are going thru, as I filed a complaint with Paypal two days before receiving my order. The product came to me as discribed and as shown, but the company needs to communicate more with the public or it is going to see more negative comments which could easily be avoided.",48,25-54,M

"I was very happy with the diamond that I ordered. As soon as the funds were confirmed (wire transfer), the friendly staff worked to meet my needs and made sure that I received my product in time by allowing for Sat shipping. The reason why I didn't give them 5 stars, even though they could have earned it, is because of the delayed time it took to confirm the wire transfer. ...if paying with a wire transfer, make sure to follow up with Brilliance because my wire transfer had an error due to their bank.  Even though the funds had posted on tues, they were not able to verify it. I wired it on Monday and received the item Saturday, paid $25 extra for Sat delivery to ensure delivery. Just follow up with them right away and you will be fine! Overall, I was very please with my experience and I love the diamond I found on their website! Def would recommend and will buy again from Brilliance!",29,25-54,F

"First off I usually never get extended warranties but when I purchased a Hisense TV from Tiger Direct something told me to get the warranty and would you believe one month after the warranty expired the TV started to act up shuting off and on,I called square trade and spoke to a fine gentleman who seemed to know the problem right off,he over nighted the parts and set up a TV repair man in my area to come to my house to fix it, which he did in about an hour and so far I'm a happy man.Square Trade Rules",69,65+,M

"Over a month we are not getting calls/texts/ and voice mail errors out. Called customer service, they gave us a $15 credit on an over $200 per month account. We visited the local store all they do is reset phone and profile and say sorry it will probably be fixed in a week, 2 weeks, a month as we update to Spark. Meanwhile I cant get calls should my kids be sick/hurt etc when I am working. Cant communicate with family, clients etc. This is BULL. This is also a breech of contract, I paid to have a phone service for my family.. and I am not able to use the service as they advertised.",33,25-54,F
We worked hard to send out email invitations for our customers past and present to leave reviews about their experience with us.

Very disappointing.,32,25-54,F
"There are good folks and bad folks on Fiverr because it is a marketplace.

"I really liked using Indeed since it grabs jobs from lots of different places and you can sort by date, positions etc. My only gripe was not really their fault, since it's a job aggregate if the companies listing online have auto-renewal for listings it will say a job is new when it is actually just a re-posted one... but again that is not Indeed doing it.",31,25-54,F
"I ordered two pieces for a halloween party in sept. 3 weeks later I called about my order and was assured it would be here by or on the 31st. With Halloween being on a Monday I explained that the costume was for parties and not trick or treating and I ordered early enough not to have to worry. I was told one piece was on back order and would be sent out as soon as it came in. One week before Halloween, I emailed ami that I no longer wanted the order. 3 days later they replied that i piece was shipped and the other piece was refunded. When I received the one piece in the mail (on the 31st) it was nothing like the picture. So I used their return label and sent it back to them. In mid Nov. I got it back with a standard form as to why they would not except the return. The form had several reasons listed, but none were checked.  Instead they hand wrote at the bottom that I didn't have some sort of return # that is required??? After several emails and 3 phone calls I finally spoke with a manager. Just to be blown off and told I was not getting my money back. Thats when I disputed the charge with my credit card. After explaining everything to my credit card company. They agreed to dispute the charge. Mid Dec. the charge was returned to my account and the dispute was finalized, or so I thought. The rest you can call coincidence if you want but on Christmas Eve, less then 2 weeks after the dispute was final and the first tim eI used my card since Sept, my card was declined for a purchase. When I called they told my there were some questionable online charges that same day that were not mine, so they voided my card and are sending me a new card with a new number. Since I rarely use that card it was easy to who might have had access to my information. Of course I can't prove who did it and the attempted charges totaled less then 22 dollars, it seems like a feeble attempt done just to mess with me. I am also very confident that this review will get a response from ami a lot faster then any of my complaints that went directly to them.",49,25-54,F

"This website is a SCAM!! BANKRUPT!!! Since August 2013 i bought 4 bags for 4.800€, which they never sent!! I tried to contact them by email, they took so long to reply, and only to tell me they were available and going to send them. so i waited…  After a long while, i decided to cancel my orders and pick some other bags instead. I did this 3 times from August 2013 to now, mid-february 2014, more than 7 months!!!!!! And i'm a good client, I spent more than 10.000€ in a year and they sent me most of what i ordered, even if it took 6 months for some! But since August, whenever i sent them emails, when they replied (half of my messages were never answered), they gave me partial answers. On the 29/0114 i asked them to send me the bags or let me choose some others instead. They told me they cancelled the orders so i could pick something else. They didn't reply until the 12/02 to tell me they would check again. But i got sick of waiting so i asked my boyfriend, who is Italian, to have a look, as his father is a police officer and he knows people in Italy that could help me, so he called some governmental office to ask them about Fashionqueen.net, and guess what?! FASHIONQUEEN DOESN'T EXIST!!! It is not registered, the P.IVA IT04222640239 doesn't exist!! My boyfriend wrote an email to fashionqueen to ask them to send me the bags and reply to the many emails i sent them, otherwise he would sue them in order to get a refund. And guess again?! Here is the answer: ""Dear Customer We are regret to inform you that the company who manage the domain name FashionQueen.net was declared in bankrupt from the Verona Court – with sentence 192-2013 dated 18 Dicember 2013.

"I have recently started using Enliven Coconut Body Butter. I purchased this product because I had recently read about how good coconut is for the skin, and for a while I had been looking for a natural coconut moisturiser which was not tested on animals and which did not contain too many added chemicals or artificial ingredients. The Enliven body butter was the only product I could find which met all my criteria and it was really good value too - much cheaper than similar products. I have now been using it for about a week and it is a beautiful product.  It smells great and it glides onto my skin, leaving it silky smooth. I love this product, shall continue to use it and recommend it to all. Thanks!",37,25-54,F

"Best price on the web.  Actually found the same price at CarRentals.com but RentalCars.com gives a 5% rebate through Mr. Rebates and the other company is only 3%. Very easy to use. The nice lady at Enterprise gave us a free upgrade from the Ford Focus(Economy) to a brand new Chrysler 200(Midsize).  The complimentary bottled waters was very nice too. Total cost for one week in Jacksonville was $129.80.  We were also able to add my wife as a driver for no additional charge. The only issue was the gas.  I have always returned rental cars full in the past, but the price they offered was less, so I figured why not.  I wondered if there was a catch as the price was 15 cents a gallon less than on the street, but the lady said there were no other charges. Well, it turned out the lady did not fully explain it and when we dropped off they were going to charge for a full tank while there was more than a quarter tank left.  I spoke to another nice lady in the rental office and she adjusted it to accurately reflect the fuel remaining. Excellent overall and I will definitely us both RentalCars.com and Enterprise again in the future.",42,25-54,M

"I first came across some supplements from Sports Food on amazon.com while idly browsing for some weight loss options for myself. I googled them and sure enough, I found their site. After a few minutes into browsing the site, I decided to try out their green tea since it is one of the safest products available for weight loss and nowadays everyone seems to be using it. I was not exactly expecting great results but it worked for me. Not only did I lose 3.5 pounds in the first two weeks, more importantly it made me much more alert and energetic which is a big thing for a mother of 3 young kids. Since the product was moderately priced it was perfect for a trial and when it worked for me, I also introduced my husband to it. Once he had lost a few measly pounds, he took the big plunge and decided he would go head-on into dieting and muscle building so that his flab can once again faintly resemble a stomach. Accordingly, he is planning to order few muscle building supplements once he has lost some more weight and settled into a good gym routine. We also tried their Fat burner which was on a special offer. Though it did not suit me much since my digestive system could not take it, my husband found it to be extremely effective. Me? I am happy with the slow and steady green tea and would recommend Sports Food products to anyone who is looking to lose weight. Their website is easy to browse and their selection of products just perfect – not too few, yet not so many that you get lost in the details. The product are usually dispatched the same day and reaches within 2-4 days. The support staff is polite and helpful. What more could you want?",34,25-54,F

"*This review is in reference to the ""Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain-Free Salmon Recipe Natural Revolutionary Diet"", which I found on your website 2 months ago for the low price of $49.99 each, w/free s + h.  I also received the added incentive of $15.00 off the order when I signed up for the 'Auto-Ship' program.  Not only did my first order arrive in lightning-speed time, (less than 48 hours from when the order was placed), it also boasts of a generous 'Expiration Date' of over 1 year's time, but I paid far less per bag than even Amazon.com has ever offered to me!  Looks like you'll have a loyal customer for some time to come.  Thanks MrChewy.com! Sincerely,       JJ2007 ""When I met my last rescue pet, Dixie, approximately 8.5 years ago, she was a real mess--both externally and internally. She exhibited a nervous condition (G.E.R.D.) that my vet said was due to her previous horrendous living conditions; that is to say, that everything that went down her goozle promptly came right back up! She was painfully emaciated, skeletal almost, and her blood-work was all over the place. So, after a round of IV fluids and 2 small bags of the 'Science Diet' chow, Dixie came home with me to recuperate and to learn how to live in a loving home. The first thing I did was to research which pet foods would address her particular condition; I knew that I didn't want to keep her on the 'Science Diet' regimen--it's too full of ingredients which I feel don't belong in a proper diet for dogs. Lo' and behold, I stumbled upon the ""Blue Buffalo Wilderness"" formula for dogs. It seemed like a good fit, due to all of the proper ratios (protein/fat) and is totally ""GRAIN-FREE"". Viola! The rest, as they say, is history....8.5 years later, Dixie now weighs in at approximately 24 loving, happy pounds of my friendly and well-adjusted best friend.""",56,55-64,F

I think 3 months of waiting time is already too long, that's why im crying foul. I'm still crossing my fingers they can get the job done. As for now, i am not recommending your service to any one.",25,25-54,M
Unbelievably good deals coupled with a vast collection.  The discounts and offers that run daily add excellent opportunities to try new products before risking larger purchases.  Delivery is fast and prompt.  Not enough positive words for this wonderful website!!!,22,15-24,M
"We were quite happy with Viator's offerings. The only issues we had were that because we were staying in an apartment through AirBnB it meant that we actually had to travel to get to Viator's limited pickup zones, so basically any savings we made going via AirBnB were negated by the taxi ride to the pickup zones. Also, one of the bus trips were a bit clunky, we had to get off and wait for a second mini bus to get to San Diego. The bus took a lot longer than expected, but the driver was great and even made the effort to locate our hostel. These were just a couple of things of note, but overall it was a great service which I hope to use once again on my upcoming trips.",29,25-54,M

I was truly impressed by the price of the Vamo kit it was exactly as described! I was not happy with the tank that came with the kit due to the air hole being on the 510 screw thread.

I do love this company they have the best prices on all of the supplements I use the only thing i dont like is high shipping costs when shipped to afghanistan since I am a deployed soldier.,29,25-54,M
"The line above says it all really. Delivered the flowers a day late!, the vase and the flowers arrived seperately?! and when the vase arrived it was smashed.. I reported the problem and received a standard email reply which talked about flowers and not my problem of  a broken vase. They did send out a new vase to my mum in law but it was hardly great service and I thought they wud have at least sent the flowers again too as way of an apology. I will never use them again.",37,25-54,F

"My buddy referred me to Supplementwarehouse.com about 2 years ago and it has remained a constant source of muscle building power for me since.  I, too, have been a customer of GNC for many years.  I still go there, in case, I need to re-up at the snap of the finger, but supplementwarehouse blows GNC out of the water in comparison.  The retail prices are nearly cut in half, if not more, and I usually get everything within a couple days.  The shipping costs are always an eyesore but overall, this site is the best around.",26,25-54,M

Flights, Pick up from airports and hotels and other transportation arrangements, clean and safe hotels with courteous staff and most of all the English speaking guides made our journey to Peru a smooth sailing one.

"I'm usually very on the ball at seeking reviews before placing orders especially for expensive items. What was I thinking of on this occasion? I guess I was taken in by their web site stating item was available. I didn't realise it was to be imported. Although I placed order in good time for Christmas it didn't arrive as date got nearer. Got in touch as was told stock was an issue. I decided to cancel order as no date could be given. I'm still trying to get a refund a month later. I'm now passing over to my bank to pursue under the credit act. So wish I'd reviewed company first and read the many, many reviews of from those that have had similar unhappy experiences. Please avoid Simply Electronics. They're Simply Appalling. Correspondence polite but worthless. This company needs investigating.",54,25-54,M
"Very competitive prices and loads of choice. Great to be able to pick a time to suit me. When the fitter arrived he was quick, polite and did the job well. I would have given five stars if it wasn't for the fact I have a wheel wobble at 70mph. I didn't have this before so must put it down to wheel balancing. To be fair, I haven't been back in touch as I'm certain etyres would put it right but it should be right 1st time. That said, I would use again and recommend.",53,25-54,M
"Bed arrived quickly and is very well made. Instructions took a little time to get to grips with but once you get going its not too difficult. When constructed it aint going nowhere!

"Well the only thing good about this company so far was there fast service getting the part to me. YES! The wrong part and they have no way to get hold of them only to fill out a slip which they say they will get back to you. There 1-800 free number gives you three choices, but a voice comes on saying there phone calls are so full they can't get back to you. If you call there regular number some guy named Buster answers saying he is away from his desk to leave message, but then you find out that his message service is full, so I went to my bank and we are doing this the legal way, and they have so many days to get my refund to me or have legal actions take agaisnt them. If you go online and read the reviews about this company there is no good reviews in there favor, so until I get my refund from them this company SUCKS!",70,65+,M

I have been using priceline to get rooms due to relocation for my job. This past week my job told me after I booked a room that they didn't need me. I attempted to get a refund for the room I booked and was told there was no way to get one. So I ended up spending 300.00 for a room for a week that I didn't have to spend. I think the policy needs to be revisited for occasions such as the one I stated. I have used this site on several occasions but will now consider other avenues.  I will not recommend this site to any of my business partners nor friends.,43,25-54,F

"UPDATE: OK so after holding for another hour... finally got this very nice man in india who spoke great english.. negotiated to give me a credit 80% of my costs good for a flight anywhere with same carrier, a cost of $200 change plane fee to pay to the carrier... so I rebooked to go see Grandpa.  Not my first choice but at least they tried.  This took way to long, was a complete hassle when through 5 people to finally get someone to help me but ... cost me a couple of hundred dollars more and at least I wasn't totally out of pocket on this flight. history: So you go online, you buy your ticket, you buy trip cancellation insurance and all looks good. Then you get an email every 5 hours trying to sell you more tickets... haven't gotten them to turn that off yet.  Now my trip was cancelled.  Yesterday I spent 4 hours on hold, then an Asian-sounding agent I could barely understand came on the phone and after about 20 minutes of futzing around said he couldn't help me and transferred me to the ""Concerned Dept"" .  This chap futz around for a few minutes only to tell me he didnt cover CheapoAir problems and that I had to call 800-566-2345... which turns out to be the same number I had before... Today I am on hold for 45 minutes and still now response.  This travel company doesn't seem to care.  If you buy a ticket... dont bother to buy the insurance, it isn't good for anything and of course you will never get these guys on the phone.

At 1735, I rang Better Bathrooms back to inform them I was still waiting and had been all day.

"My granddaughter needed this book for a course she would study over the Christmas break, starting on December 23.  We learned of the need about a week into December.  I found the book at BookByte, new, and at a reasonable price.  The book was shipped on time and arrived on time.  It was in perfect condition.  There simply was nothing wrong in the transaction.  I go to BookByte whenever I need to search for a particular book - whether it's for me or for a family member.  Thanks. May you have a happy and prosperous year 2014!",73,65+,F
"This is my first time replacing a laptop screen.  I was worried that I wouldn't get it right, that I'd order the wrong screen, that I'd break something, that I'd get it apart and be unable to get it back together, etc.  First, there's no easy way to know the exact model of the screen without taking the screen out.  Second, there's not necessarily a tutorial video for the exact model of laptop one is dealing with.  Still, with the tools provided by Laptopscreen.com, I made a very good guess for the screen model, I watched their video tutorial on a similar laptop model, and was able to bring my Dell Inspiron 9400 back to life with a beautiful bright new display. The screen arrived promptly; it was well-packaged; the price was reasonable.  I'm a happy camper.  If I ever need another screen, I'm coming back to you!",73,65+,F
"I LOVE YesStyle!! So many of their items ship the next day, they have amazing deals, and everything is so cute! I've tried many other websites that sell clothing from Asia, and they've all turned out to be flops. YesStyle is everything I could've ever wanted in a clothing website! I recommend YesStyle to the moon and back. Happy Shopping!",19,15-24,F
"I have placed 2 orders with Memoryc in the past 3 months. One is always somewhat skeptical when dealing with a new vendor, especially over the internet. I can't say enough about the exemplary customer service I received from Memoryc. The first order: I was given a tracking number and an approximate delivery date, while following the orders progress I noticed it seemed to be not making any progress, I emailed Memoryc...'hoping' to get a response...I received an immediate reply, through the course of several emails it was found out that my order and several others had been lost by shipper. Memoryc immediately sent out a replacement shipment...as it turned out the shipper found the missing items, Memoryc contacted me again and let me know that the quickest delivery would be with the original shipment....the order was delivered within a day of the original delivery date.....Memoryc contacted me after I signed for the package and asked if everything was as it should be...then gave me a credit for the freight I had paid on the order....unbelievable! Second order: No difference than the first order I was given a tracking # and delivery date...this time on time - actually ahead of time. The issue this time was my fault...I had ordered the wrong memory for my laptop....I emailed Memoryc - they immediately gave me a RGA and helped me verify that I was ordering the right part#. As it turns out, I sent the memory back in a US postal envelope..somehow the envelope opened during transit and the memory was lost....Memoryc notified me and sent me a picture of the envelope when they received it....what could I say at that point....they said a lot....they first offered me a voucher for a discount on my next order...then turned around a few days later and give me the credit for the memory....again unbelievable! Giving me the credit was far and beyond there responsibility...but very much appreciated! In this day and age of 'Numbers' - it is nice to find a company who cares, and one you can actually contact and get immediate answers and HELP. THANK YOU MEMORYC....",59,55-64,F
"I follow a bunch of shows, some of which are on Hulu, while others are scattered at various places all over the web. Watch.io makes it easy to find the episodes i want and go straight to the player. I also like that they do no have any advertisements and the site loads quickly",34,25-54,M
"I have been using Netflix for about a year, primarily using the streaming option with a Wii, and I have been thrilled. There are occasional service issues, but they do not impact viewing significantly. No more so than a commercial. My only real complaint has the been the user interface, which they changed in July. I switched to using Watch.io for browsing new titles, but still have the Netflix service and now I'm happy.",34,25-54,M

"I was on the whole impressed with my shopping experience with AO and the level of customer service I received after placing my order.  Within 10 minutes of placing the order online my phone was ringing; an AO employee thanking me for my order and checking delivery conditions at my house for my appliance.  Impressive!  However, from then on I was literally bombarded with phone calls/text messages to advise on shipment/delivery dates & times, even the name of the man who would deliver!  A couple of these information calls/texts happened quite late in the evening/ very early in the morning when I didn't really want to be disturbed about a fridge.",37,25-54,F

I did not get my e-tickets right after I purchased them, was a little concerned, so I emailed Ticket Club and they were quick with a response that the tickets were sold before the on sale so I would have to wait until the person I bought the tickets from actually had the tickets and sent them to me. I thought it was so cool that I could buy the tickets before they went on sale through Ticket Master. I'm am completely satisfied with my Ticket Club experiences!",23,15-24,F

"Our stay at Residence Inn Downtown/Union Hill in KCMO couldn't have been better.  The clerk who greeted us was friendly and when we only had one bed in our room, she quickly moved us to a room with two beds.  Rooms were clean and well-decorated in a beautiful city setting.  The continental breakfast was excellent, very satisfying, and provided a nice variety of foods in a comfortable environment.  The shuttle service the hotel provides was safe, efficient, and much-appreciated.  There should be no one who couldn't be comfortable and satisfied with the type of hotels that I have always experienced booking through Priceline.  Thank you once again Priceline!

"I bought Black Ops 2 from CJS cdkeys and had no trouble whatsoever doing it. Autokey had a bit of friction with my phone service provider regarding their verification key, and I had to borrow my roomate's phone (it's because mine is a prepaid). Other than that everything went nicely and took like 5 minutes to get my key activated on Steam. Price wasn't lowest on market, but I'd rather pay a couple bucks extra to make sure my key is a legit key from a legit source and not some russian black market key that might get banned any day. Would buy again, recommend to people who want a fast & reliable key site.",19,15-24,M
"I wanted to get Dark Souls for a decent price so I googled around a bit and these guys came up. Did some investigation and they seemed trustworthy, so I went through with the order. I waited for a few hours, and after I didn't see a key I just went to bed. Next morning the key was in my email and I activated it on Steam - worked fine and no trouble whatsoever during or after the transaction. Site's selection is quite narrow but if they have what you are looking for, go ahead and buy it. Recommended if you want to save money, not recommended if you want your key ASAP.",18,15-24,M

"Steam has been a huge part of my gaming career. I have over 400 games on steam and have only spent $2,429.69. That is an average of FIFTEEN CENTS PER GAME. You can't beat that with ANY console or other game provider. My only problem with steam is that they do not have a very good support service. Refunds are rare for bad titles or incomplete games. Also it is very easy  to get your account banned via money transactions. Overall I recommend Steam and Valve to anyone looking for a great way to receive and update games.",23,15-24,M
This has to be the most reputable key site there is. All keys are gathered at lower prices and sold to us better than even steam or origin can. I feel very comfortable and trust CJ's with my purchase. Thanks!,23,15-24,M

The website gave me an in depth knowledge of everything, and the customer service was fantastic!  It was great to actually talk to a gemologist on the phone.

On many of the tour's details they mention that they do make a point to do this.

"Absolutely the worst. Unless you consider ""fast"" 6 weeks +.. Also, the repair job was terrible. I had two arms replaced on a pair of Chanel frames. When the estimate came through about the repair they asked if I wanted new reading lenses put in. I chose the lenses and paid for the amount and was told they would be mailed out quickly. When I finally received them the two arms were attached differently and were ""floppy"" - cheap workmanship, AND there were NO lenses that I had paid for, and they charged me $30 shipping. The online chat person Arial was unhelpful and would not let me speak with a manager. A wholly AWFUL experience after waiting almost 7 weeks. I called AMEX and disputed the charge and they found in my favor, refunding the full amount. So, BUYER BEWARE. Go elsewhere.",53,25-54,F

I ordered a helmet. They took 11 days to ship my order and never communicated with me until I called them on the 10th day. They shipped only after I filed a paypal claim.

"Yesstyle is extremely versatile, very reliable, and reasonably priced... especially on shipping! They're usually in my price range as a college student with only so many funds. Plus they make it easy to find what you're looking for, suits, sweatshirts, dresses, frills, studs, skulls, roses, you name it they probably have it! I also really like the fact that they show models wearing the product and what you see is actually what you're buying. On top of that they usually give you a couple ideas on what to mix and match with the item and I really appreciate that as I prefer to know how my clothes are actually going to fit which is why before Yesstyle I was always really skeptical about purchasing online. I don't shop from other online stores for clothes or accessories ever, not even U.S. stores, because Yesstyle has never let me down when it comes to their product. Also the shipping is great! I've ordered from Japanese/Korean/Chinese/Thai stores and I can't tell you how frustrating it is to buy something and wait nearly 4 weeks and it's still not there. But Yesstyle doesn't do that, they tell you when they'll be able to ship, and the longest I've seen 7-14 days, but you can always narrow your search to ""Ready to ship"" and it'll get to you in about 3-4 days after order if you pay the 9.99 for 3 day shipping. The longest I've seen is five, but that was once and five days isn't even that bad. P.S. the 9.99 3 day shipping is highly recommended, it's a couple dollar difference, but if you live in the states, it can take a while before EMS finally decides you can whatever you bought. NO FAULT OF YESSTYLE, that's just my personal experience with EMS. TL;DR They're you're favorite store even if you haven't shopped with them yet.",22,15-24,F

Rocky worked with me to get all of these just right via e-mails. I also have sporrans and belts from USAK.

Whether it was an item that needed repair or a total replacement, the claim process was straight forward and met my every expectation.

I have always had great experience with the Name Your Price bookings.  As long as I do a 2 1/2 star or above I have never been disappointed in Priceline.  The only thing I wish would be hotels would still give points for their club members in spite of booking through priceline.,59,55-64,F

"I love Yesstyle because they carry clothes that you can't typically find in American stores.  Yesstyle carries cute Asian clothing for a pretty good price.  I'm a teenager and so I can't afford to spend a lot shopping, but Yesstyle's pricing is very reasonable.  I like how for most products, many pictures of the product and/or a model wearing the product is provided.  In addition, the accessibility of reviews from other people really help me make a decision as to whether or not I want to purchase an item.  Overall, just an amazing company that has what I'm looking for!",18,15-24,F

"We ordered 5 items. The Le Corbusier chairs and sofas were supposed to be leather : these are PU leather, feeling and smelling like plastic, with that distinctive pattern of faux leather, totally regular and homogenous, which is NEVER the case with leather. Website advertised semi-aniline leather. Office chair was supposed to be totally constructed in chrome steel and castors in steel and black gum/plastic. Seating part is, but the base, feet and castors are painted white metal and castors are in grey cheap plastic ! And again leather is PU leather. Plus it's dirty, blackened with dust in places, stained with some red colours in others. Eames chair and ottoman were supposed to be of a ""Tan"" colour. In fact, it's a ""mottled light brown"" colour, which is very well identified and proposed by other copies sellers, and is definitely not ""Tan"" as advertised. Last but not least, chromes have too many scratches, dots, marks,etc. A total disaster. When you buy on the Internet, the only way to have normal consumer experience is in pictures and description. Here, nothing matches pictures and description. First response of customer service was : we will check if our suppliers may not have committed a mistake in materiel choice. So suppliers would ""change"" leather to PU leather without previous notice ? Really ?",109,65+,M

"The Parts Geek CSR that helped me (Chris M) is as good as they get.  He made me feel that PG truly wanted my business while presenting a thoroughly professional, yet personable image.  You could sense that his ultimate goal was to ensure PG met all of my automotive needs.  He is quite an asset to Parts Geek. As for the positive efforts of Parts Geek - I was totally blown away when I found the parts I had ordered Friday afternoon in my mailbox early Monday afternoon.  That type of delivery is nearly impossible except for very expensive services like UPS or Fed Ex Next Day, but this package was simply 1st Class USPS postage.  When a problem, of my doing, showed up, Parts Geek assured me they would take whatever steps they needed to solve my dilemma. In my opinion, that’s the kind of service you get from a local parts supplier that you build up over many years - yet this was my first visit to Parts Geek.  If they all go this smoothly, I’ll never need to shop anywhere else. C L McLeod (The Wolf)",66,65+,M
"I do a considerable amount of hobby trading on eBay.  I found an item I wanted to build and present to a physician friend who has provided me with competent and compassionate healthcare over the past decade, but found the eBay price and S&H to be unrealistic for a new but relatively common product.  I decided to research the product on HobbyLinc, just to see if my theory of price gouging held true.  Even having to pay GA sales tax, the HobbyLink price was well below HALF of the asking price with S&H charges for the identical item on eBay. There is a moral to this story.  The trust you put into an on-line purchase must be equaled by the trustworthiness of the seller.  With eBay, you are not dealing with a company that must maintain its reputation of fairness, but an individual who can assume a new identity from one transaction to the next.  Buyer beware. Trust has a tangible value and should be considered whenever making purchases too good to be true, even more so than when the circumstances have already caused your defense mechanisms to activate.  The cost of peace of mind is sometimes negligible when compared to what is at risk. Best regards, Grey Wolf - Columbus GA",66,65+,M
"I waited so long for this to happen because subconsciously I was terrified of the end results so I kept procrastinating about seriously finding someone to build my site.

"I have used Easytobook for many of our vacation trips and always found our reservations to be waiting for us without glitches. I am sure I could do a lot of research and come up with similar results but it is a lot simpler for me to get to the Easytobook website and let them do the legwork. The information is accurate and the rates are competitive. I only use other booking services for my personal travel when Easytobook does not cover the specific area I am interested into, or if for any particular reason I need to book through a different channel.",74,65+,M

"Priceline.com provides great deals. I would like priceline.com to allow a bid on a hotel to be changeable solely by changing the price and not as they have it set up now, which requires changing the price and star rating when one re-bids after one's initial bid is rejected. This is to say that priceline requires the bidder to bid the same amount for a lower-starred hotel as they had just bid for a higher-starred hotel.",65,65+,M

Every communique included all the ways and times the company and Robert could be reached of I had any questions at all.

Garden a rea is lovely and warm on a sunny day. Staff was great.  Professional, helpful, courteous and very pleasant. Breakfast each morning was very good, with a great selection of foods.  Our only complaint was there was not a TV guide on the cable set or in writing.  We couldn't find anything on the TV in the evenings. We had a great time, walked everywhere because we were within blocks of everything.  Would return again anytime and reccomend it to all our family and friends.",68,65+,F

"When firms ask for reviews of products purchased, they frequently only publish those that are favourable to the firm concerned.  It is quite a change to find one that publishes reviews whether or not they are favourable or someone has had an unfortunate experience with one.  Trustpilot has brought the reviewing of products to a standard that can be trusted to relay the dealings people have had with a firm, be it good, not so good or bad.  Anyone who has had Trustpilot as their reviewer is tops for my list of firms to deal with online shopping.",75,65+,F

"If people don't know, by now, what to expect from Ryanair - then they should. Always on time - you don't have to have 'the extras' -  Living abroad, I always use Ryanair on my frequent trips to the UK from Italy. I have yet to meet a rude flight attendant - although some of the ground staff at Stansted need a few lessons in customer relations. But, after more than 10 years of travelling at least 12 times a year with Ryanair, I'll continue to do so, with pleasure.  You get what you pay for - or you go elsewhere.  And then, would it be much better?????",69,65+,F

I was looking for Euros for a forthcoming trip and found the Currency Club through price comparison; best rate for delivery and nearly matched midmarket rate quoted on Xe.com.

Will definitely recommend to family and friends and be a return customer.,66,65+,F
